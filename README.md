# Objectivity_Prediction_Web_App
 A ML web app which detect objectivity of the text

I built a classifier model which detects whether a text is subjective or objective, based on the genre-annotated dataset GINCO, machine-translated to English.

I first experiment with different models to assess which model is the most suitable for the task.

Then I deploy the model by publishing it in a web application, by using the Flask (following the tutorial here: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-easily-build-your-first-machine-learning-web-app-in-python-c3d6c0f0a01c)
