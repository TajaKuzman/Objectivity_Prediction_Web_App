We are a special team with a special group within it. It's a mix of young and experienced players. I'm sure that in the deciding match, each one of us gave a little bit of what we needed to be successful.

__label__subjective 17 replies to " Even in the municipality of Ravenna " in a domestic way " " <p/> What is it with this journalist that she writes things that are two years old, and populist ones at that. The SDS party got 10 councillors and a mayor. The SD party got two councillors, Zares got 3 councillors, the NSI got one, etc... Around the same time, the seats on the committees were also divided up, or the SDS got even fewer than it could have. Check the data available. The most important is the Supervisory Committee, where the opposition has the chair and the majority of members. In this way, things are 'balanced'. Of course, the glass can always be half full or half empty, depending on which eyes are looking at it. It is normal, however, that the opposition always wants to minimise the successes and inflate the weaknesses to the extreme. All credit to the mayor and his team for what they have achieved in the town, and it may not be all good, but it is far from all bad. <p/>It is only the political staffing that bothers me, but I would like to point out that many of these SDS directors have improved things and put things on the right footing, and nobody mentions that. I am not taking sides, but I think that, yes, it is not all black. Many times when I go to the flatlands, where I was born, I find that many people are negative, and they all tell the same stories, and it is quite clear to me that somebody has set them up against the mayor. But perhaps we already know of a candidate for mayor in the forthcoming local elections? ? ? It also bothers me that the freedoms are being used for the benefit of one political party, namely the SD. Its members are always at these protests, and in this case the protests, which I support, are taking on political overtones. People should say what they think, not be persuaded to do so by one political option. <p/> After all, it is the SD, or the young forum, that is behind everything, and they have their noses up in everything good that is done in Ravenna. And what the fuck is that to the demonstrator in front of the municipality from Ravne! Let the others go and demonstrate in front of their municipalities, because in the end Prevale has two vice-mayors. No, it is only Ravne that is under attack. The Young Forum of the Mežiška dolina Valley is, as far as we can understand, the young forum of the whole valley, not just Ravne, and they should do something elsewhere, not just go around Ravne on the orders of their silver uncles from behind the scenes. <p/> Who reads this red Dnevnik ... and just ask yourselves and investigate who paid some money to this Mojca to write such an article (a paid article). Kudos to Mayor Rozen, he has done a lot for the people ... but only those who want to line their pockets are slandering ... a little morgen, you will be waiting ... <p/> I have to speak up. I am an ordinary citizen just observing what is happening in Ravne. I am also interested to see the recordings of the municipal council meetings. I must say that I am VERY SATISFIED with the leadership of our municipality. However, it is obvious that Councillors Halilovič and Vrhovnik are doing everything they can to undermine the work of the mayor and his team. What is the purpose of such action is clear to all. Because they feel that there is not enough publicity at the meetings themselves, they have to take to the streets. That is why I was not surprised to see, in the video footage of the assembly in front of the municipal building, mainly supporters of the pole that has too few members on the municipal council. Therefore, people - do not be fooled into thinking that this assembly was about improving the situation. It was about letting the street allow those who failed in the elections to rise - whether that is good or bad for the citizens. <p/>I see you are all more right-wing up here, I tell you we have a trunk full of your politics and don't dream that only reds are protesting in the street. I for one am for honest politics be it left or right, I have no bad words for Rozen but I don't think he has kept the right deputy mayor. <p/> Aljaž Vrhovnik will be loud? A teenager who rushes to the trough more than a calf to a cow, pretending to be clever about things that logically he has no clue about, because he is simply being a child. I have nothing against young people, but what is too much is too much, and he is running for mayor - and half the stupid journalists quote him. I don't know who is the bigger half-ass. Vrhovnik was lying drunk in front of Presa last weekend, why don't you write about it) <p/> Zlatko Halilovič -&gt; has he raised his voice? Logically, it is more difficult to do anything else. <p/> Blog author: Why don't you publish what is the difference between the annual salary of a councillor and a deputy mayor? Aren't you interested? <p/> And to the left- and right-wing narrow-minded, greetings and a happy and prosperous 2013, in deeds, not in words. <p/> The Governor is supposed to be a representative of young people, but not enough to stand up for young people and their interests. But he is only looking at his own narrow interests, how to make a political career, no matter how much it costs, and who he is going to shit on for it. Shame! It is also a shame what kind of representatives the youth have in our country - they (we) are guilty of this, unfortunately - but why do we give such people a voice? He burnt out in the next election - GOTOF IT IS! (if people have any salt in their heads)

__label__subjective Kundalini Yoga <p/> GUIDE <p/> Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan is the ideal discipline for the modern man of today. <p/> The techniques of Kundalini Yoga bring us quite quickly to a balance between the physical body, mind and soul.The well thought out and composed practice units called kriyas help us to support a healthy, contented and spiritual lifestyle. They work in a targeted way with a specific purpose, such as to strengthen the immune and nervous systems, balance the functioning of the glands and internal organs, increase circulation, maintain psycho-physical vitality, ease depressive states, etc. In addition, they enhance the functioning of the neutral or meditative mind, the faculties of intelligence, perseverance and perfection. A clear, neutral and intuitive mind gives us the ability to become aware of and change our own patterns, fears and habits that prevent us from moving forward in life. <p/> This is why Kundalini Yoga is so appropriate for today, empowering us, uplifting us and building a foundation to cope with the stresses and turbulence of today, a time of moving into the Aquarian Age, an age of higher consciousness and peace. <p/> "Kundalini Yoga is a technology of knowing and awakening consciousness that leads us to the original Self. Usually this consciousness, which we call kundalini, is dormant within us and therefore awareness and experience of the Self is more or less limited. Awareness can be awakened and expanded up to Infinity and only then can I experience my true Self. Infinity is my original Self. In this expanded state nothing is lacking. The process of growth through Kundalini Yoga is the natural unfoldment of one's own nature. The obstacles on the path of growth are only the attachments to the habits of the past and the fears of the Infinite or the expanded Self."
__label__subjective Bohinjska Bistrica - The weekend is upon us, and if the weather is nice, the car crowds will once again flock to the tourist spots. Also to Bohinj, where parking has always been a problem due to too many cars and not enough parking spaces. But as Miro Sodja, Director of the Bohinj Municipal Administration, says, there are solutions here too. This year, a larger, more affordable car park has been opened at the beginning of the village of Ribčev Laz, from where a regular free shuttle service to Lake Bohinj is also organised. Subsidised bus services have also been made more frequent in the lower and upper Bohinj valley, and the new bridge over the Sava Bohinjska has made the bicycle ride from Bohinjska Bistrica to the lake increasingly attractive. As the Director of Tourism Bohinj, Klemen Langus, said, they are taking small steps to help calm traffic during the peak summer tourist season. The possibility of renting electric bicycles could also be an interesting alternative to driving, Langus said.
__label__objective National Election Commission wins prestigious international award <p/> Ljubljana, 09 December (STA) - The National Election Commission of the Republic of Slovenia (NEC) was awarded the prestigious Election Commission of the Year Award at the 7th International Symposium on Electoral Affairs, held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on 3-4 December. At the same time, the DVK was also awarded in the Electoral Management category, the commission said. <p/> According to DVK Director Dušan Vučko, this was the first international award ceremony of its kind in the field of elections and was organised by the London-based International Centre for Parliamentary Studies. Central Electoral Commissions from all continents competed for the awards. <p/> "The work of the National Electoral Commission of the Republic of Slovenia was considered impressive, especially for countries affected by the economic crisis, and therefore worthy of an award," said the nine-member awards committee in its explanatory statement. The SCC has not only improved the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall electoral process, but has also brought it closer to the voters, according to the award committee. <p/> According to Vuček, the awards demonstrate the correct orientation and conviction of the PSC that it is essential to bring the electoral commissions and the electoral process itself closer to the voters, and that the electoral process should be carried out as rationally as possible, but not at the expense of the voters or at the expense of lowering the already-established standards of democratic elections.

__label__subjective Fairy tales and stories <p/> ABOUT Fairy tales and songs <p/> Children, do you like fairy tales and songs? I love them so much! It's cold outside and I'm writing these animal stories for you. My thoughts rush back to my childhood in the Slovenian Highlands. I see our family - the Ježe family, we were told - gathered in a vineyard around a kerosene lamp. Mica is reading stories, my father is mending shoes, the rest of us are shelling pumpkins for oil, sifting buckwheat for kasha sausages, shredding corn off the cob for corn fritters or sifting beans. Some women spin. <p/> No, I can't say that the somewhat pale light of the kerosene lamp made my childhood any sadder, on the contrary, it was quite joyful, full of curiosity, longing and duty.... <p/> In the dim glow of the kerosene lamp, the shadows in the corners and haylofts were full of fears, especially when our neighbour Ferdinand - the eternal young man - told us about the enchanted queens in the enchanted castle, about the dragon who had come for the castle's daughter, about the serpent in the spring, about the witches, the devil, the goblins, and about death. Fairy tales about the nuns and the judges must have been told to each other by the ancient Slavs. And Ferdinand had to tell us the happy one about the "ass-gold" several times. <p/> It was cold outside. Snow covered the hill and down the hill, and smoke from the chimneys of the dwarf wood-houses was drawn straight up into the sky, across which the mysterious moon passed from time to time. But it was warm behind the frosted shutters. A fire crackled in the stove or in the cooker. Somewhere in the distance, on another hill, dogs barked and howled at the pale moon... <p/> At that time, when I was young, nature was still clean. There was laughter and weeping, songs and quarrels, and then again visits, feasts, baptisms, funerals and carols. <p/> Today, all that is very different. After the first, a second war, four years of suffering and misery each time. Between the wars, life changes. The Partisans liberated our homeland, we erected memorials to our dead heroes. We began to live a new life, as our greatest hero, Tito, had envisioned in his early youth. <p/> Today, instead of a kerosene lamp in the middle of a pile of beans on the table, a light bulb from the ceiling glows. Electricity lights, heats, drives machines and cooks. Today, it is not Ferdinand telling the neighbour's fairy tales. We sit in front of the television and see and hear what is happening in our homeland and far beyond. We talk long distances and call acquaintances by pressing the electric bell... <p/> We could hardly have dreamt of all this in our youth. But nature was cleaner, wider and quieter. Perhaps at carnivals or at feasts, village musicians would swish. And on occasions, the song came straight from the throat, not from the radio or from gramophone records. It came from the heart, our beautiful Slovenian song. <p/> The past turned into memories. I can still see my mother looking after me when I go out into the world, to art, to Golden Prague. After many years, I have returned to my Slovenian hills, among you, to tell you some animal tales, sing a song, make a clay sculpture and paint a picture. You see, I can do it all! <p/> Written on the leg after New Year 1974

The Act on the second track, which entered into force on 21 July, stipulates that this must be done within 30 days of the Act's entry into force. <p/> The Government of the Republic of Slovenia, as the General Assembly, under the Second Track Act, must also recapitalise 2TDK to the amount of €20 million, adopt the company's business plan and harmonise the deed of incorporation of 2TDK.

It must prepare and adopt a regulation setting out the details of the transhipment tax and a decision setting out the details of the mark-up, and adopt an investment programme. <p/> The handover of documentation between the Directorate and 2TDK is underway, but as some of the material will also be considered by the Government of the Republic of Slovenia in its capacity as the Assembly, additional time will therefore be needed. It will be proposed to the Assembly to consider some additional subjects which are not covered by the law but which need to be considered by the Assembly because the delay of more than one year in the enactment of the law has led to new situations and legal gaps in relation to the handover.

__label__objective PEGAN, Vanja <p/> My parents Edita and my father Leander Pegan came to Piran, the birthplace of my father's mother, in the autumn of 1963. Both were teachers, my mother a class teacher at the Piran primary school, my father a brass and woodwind player at the music school, and also a brass band chaplain. In 1965 their daughter Katja was born and a year and a half later their son Vanja was born. <p/> He attended primary and music school in Piran, social science grammar school in Koper, and studied comparative literature in Ljubljana. Between 1989 and 1996 he taught classical guitar and musicology at the Music School in Sežana and Komno, and composed incidental music for theatre productions at the Primorska Drama Theatre (The Egg, The Runaway Robot, Vida Grant, The Miraculous Stone, The Little Prince), the Ljubljana City Theatre (Audition, Pahljača), the Cankarjev dom and the Helios Theatre (Brigades of Beauty) and the Glej Theatre (Don Lorenzo). <p/> He started writing as a high school student. He was also editor of the high school literary newsletter Ogledalo. He finally chose his career as a writer in 1996 and has since been teaching guitar on a part-time basis at the Comunità degli Italiani "Giuseppe Tartini" di Pirano (Community of Italians "Giuseppe Tartini" of Pirano). In 2002 he became a member of the Association of Primorska Literary Writers. In 2003 he obtained the status of a self-employed writer in culture. <p/> He writes for children and adults. In collaboration with the academic painter Fulvia Zudič, he has published the picture books Citronček in Giovanin, Mesto 2000 and Tonin. All three are multilingual. The first was awarded the 3rd International Competition for Original Illustrated Fairy Tales in Bordano, Italy (1999). Tonin was selected by the Internationale Jugendbibliothek in Munich as one of the best international children's and young people's books in 2010, and was included in the exhibition and catalogue. Tonin's picture book was thus awarded the prestigious title/prize The White Ravens 2010. He has also written the plays The Three Little Donkeys and Rosie the Shrimp and Lučka and the Most Beautiful Gift for children. Both have had several stage productions and have toured at home and abroad. <p/> He first captivated adults with his collection of short stories, Sailors' Bathing in Warm Water. This was followed by the novels The Boat and The Writer, Adam and the Pilot, then the short stories in the book The Sky of a Long Summer, the novel Journey to the Beginning of the Road and the short stories collected under the title Four Sea Miles. <p/> The publication of Pegan's books never goes unnoticed by readers, reviewers and literary critics. He put Piran and the Slovenian sea on the Slovenian literary map. "With Pegan's fiction, the sea and the seaside town enter Slovenian literature as never before". (Tucovič V., 2010) "His writing style is subtle, incisive and confessional, or in other words, Vanja's writing is colourful, melodic and poetic. What he feels, he can articulate. He is a master of describing details and interesting phrases, of interweaving past and present, of nostalgia and optimism. Reading his works carefully, one cannot fail to notice his subtle criticism of the absurd values of today's society and his awareness that we need something more than mere materialism and consumerism to live a meaningful life." (Petaros Kmetec K., Juh M., 2012) <p/> He has published in various literary magazines. Since 2009, Vanja Pegan has been the president and co-founder of the literary association and publishing house Društvo Knjižni krog.

__label__objective Chronic wrist pain <p/> Chronic wrist pain occurs gradually and is not usually the result of an acute injury. The tendons and tendon sheaths are most commonly affected due to repetitive strain. The most common of these are inflammations of the tendons of the wrist, specifically tendonitis of the extensor tendon of the thumb (Mb. DeQuervain), cysts of the tendon sheaths or the joint capsule, and bursitis in the wrist region. <p/> Wrist fractures due to circulatory disturbances, chronic ligament tears, wrist instability and wear lesions also occur. Tumour lesions are also a possible cause of pain. <p/> Recognise the symptoms <p/> The most common symptom is chronic pain, mostly related to movement or strain. When unstable, the pain intensifies with certain movements in the wrist. <p/> Alarm to see an orthopaedic surgeon <p/> When you experience wrist pain that lasts for several weeks, it is time to see an orthopaedic surgeon. <p/> Path to diagnosis <p/> A clinical examination by an orthopaedic surgeon gives an orientation on the nature of the problem or the affected wrist structures. The basic examination is an X-ray of the wrist in different projections. To clarify the exact situation, an ultrasound or MRI scan of the wrist is performed. In case of suspected instability with wrist ligament tear, additional information is obtained by contrast-enhanced MRI. <p/> Treatment methods <p/> In the case of an inflammatory cause of wrist pain, immobilisation is recommended for a short period. Physical therapy initially includes anti-inflammatory irradiation with high energy laser (HIL), and super magnetotherapy (SIS). This is followed by individual exercises to stretch and flex the tendons. <p/> Minimally invasive arthroscopic surgery is also an option for early degenerative processes. <p/> In cases of instability, wrist bone failure due to circulatory disorders or other more complex conditions following injury, more complex surgical interventions may be considered.

During this time, drivers will also obtain uniform licences and other things they need to be issued with a certificate with "normal" validity.

The report identifies success factors, good practices, highlights gaps, highlights future challenges and makes proposals for action to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs over the last five years. Further complementary reports are expected, including an annex to the Secretary-General's report in April with basic statistics on the implementation of the MDGs. A more detailed report with statistics on the implementation of the Goals will follow in June, followed by an overall assessment of the shortcomings of international cooperation in early September. <p/> "We have the knowledge and the resources to achieve the Millennium Goals," Ban stressed in his report, referring to the goals of the Millennium Declaration of 2000, which aim to end poverty, hunger, disease and significantly reduce maternal and child mortality by 2015. <p/> The report notes that some countries have made great strides in overcoming extreme poverty and hunger, increasing school enrolment and child health, expanding access to safe drinking water, strengthening control of malaria, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases, and expanding access to HIV treatment (for more information, see Millennium Development Goals: A stocktaking exercise). <p/>These successes are being seen in some of the poorest countries, proving that the MDGs are indeed achievable if we have the right policies, the right level of investment and international support. <p/> Progress has not been the same everywhere, however, and the report predicts that many countries will not reach the goals. The greatest challenges are faced by the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, some small island developing states that are most vulnerable to natural disasters, and countries facing internal unrest. <p/> The report points out that the MDGs are not being missed because the targets are unachievable or there is too little time, but rather because of unfulfilled promises, inadequate funding and a lack of accountability. The result is a failure to provide financial incentives, services, technical support and appropriate partnerships. As a result, progress in poverty eradication has been unacceptably slow, and some of the hard-won successes are being eroded by the food and financial crises. <p/> Good practices <p/> Global action to achieve the MDGs has been underway for almost ten years and a number of good practices have emerged. The most important of these are development plans at national level. Successful countries are pursuing a pragmatic policy mix, focusing on their own development capacities. International development cooperation needs to support more intensively such national development strategies and actions to strengthen their own development capacities. <p/> Of course we need economic growth, but it is not the only condition for progress. Growth must be inclusive and equitable if we are to achieve optimal poverty reduction and real progress towards the MDGs. <p/> Hard-won progress can be undone by economic and other shocks. Countries need forward-looking macroeconomic policies that can promote balanced growth across the board. For example, the Millennium Goals can be achieved through sustained public investment and development strategies designed accordingly, and universal social protection. <p/> The report stresses that financing for the MDGs must start 'at home'. Developing countries must raise and allocate their revenues accordingly, and donor countries must deliver on their promises to increase ODA. Although development aid reached its peak in 2008, countries are still largely failing to deliver on their development aid promises. <p/> Countries pledged around USD 154 billion in ODA at the G8 Gleneagles Summit in 2005 and have not kept their promises. They have under-pledged by $35 billion a year and under-pledged by $20 billion for Africa. "If promises are not kept, the poor suffer and die in even greater numbers," the report points out. <p/> The report outlines a number of promising government proposals to ensure adequate funding for the MDGs, including a new financing mechanism for better health systems and a new global approach to food security, which was elaborated at the 2009 G8 meeting in L'Aquila. These proposals need to be implemented as soon as possible if we are to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs and lay a solid foundation for the G8 and G20 meetings in Canada in June 2010. <p/> At the same time, innovative financing schemes must continue to be developed and the MDG Summit in September this year must establish a transparent mechanism to promote the delivery of global development aid pledges. Such a mechanism must have its own action plan with timetables, forms of monitoring and enforcement. <p/> UN Secretary-General Ban calls for a new 'compact' that is not just government-led, but inclusive of all stakeholders, developed and developing countries, civil society organisations, private business, philanthropy and multilateral systems. Each of these stakeholders must strive to make the most efficient use of its own resources. They must act effectively and collectively. This September, the Summit will officially take place as a high-level plenary meeting of the UN General Assembly. It will provide a unique opportunity to strengthen collective action and partnerships to achieve the Millennium Goals by 2015. <p/> "In September, we will come together to build on the achievements of the past years and to address the existing gaps. We have a shared responsibility to shape a better future for generations to come," the Secretary-General stressed. "Achieving the MDGs is only possible by delivering on our promises, with the right policies, financial incentives and sustained action."

__label__subjective I propose to the Government of Slovenia that, in the event of any illiquidity or insolvency, it should call in a popular loan of EUR 5 billion at 5% interest per annum. The moratorium on payment is 5 years and then payment of principal and interest in 5 annual instalments. <p/> The above-mentioned People's Loan shall be duly presented in the mass media and in all media in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia and citizens shall be called upon to do their utmost to help preserve the financial sovereignty of the country. <p/> All citizens of the Republic of Slovenia and all legal entities with their registered office in the Republic of Slovenia are eligible to contribute. <p/> We know from the past that we have already had similar people's loans (the Skopje earthquake, the Austro-Hungarian road loan, the famous war loans, etc.). <p/> Having said that, I would like to point out that the first way to save the banks is to sell their own assets (redundant offices, business premises, union tourism facilities in spas and by the sea and in the mountains) and to pledge and secure the claims of legal and natural persons (flats, houses, businesses, etc.), and then the state should come to the rescue. It is also necessary to limit the salaries of managers in all state-owned companies and institutions to no more than the salary of the President of the country, the Prime Minister... No one can have more, least of all the quasi-experts. For example, the director of NKBM last year reported an annual income of over 270 000 euros, the bank is in the red, Mr Kramar from Izlak has a 1 million euro bonus for 5 years of management plus salary, and NLB has almost 2 billion bad loans, which it is utopian to believe will ever be repaid. If we are playing such games and delusional thinking, all the measures taken by the government and the savings made by all the employees are meaningless. Or the recently published report by the Court of Auditors that the investment in 2 blocks for 170 prisoners at Dob Prison has risen from EUR 6 million to EUR 87 million. Of course, no one will be held accountable, and we will not show the door to any of the 'experts'. It just happens. As long as we do, we will be in for a dive. Do you remember that the Yugoslav Royal Government fled to London in 1941 with tens of tonnes of the country's gold reserves. Today, of course, I do not mean the government, which is doing its best (a few years too late, unfortunately, because we all dreamt of a success story), but individual entrepreneurs, managers and directors. Where will you go, gentlemen? <p/> When the Austrian lands (of which today's Slovenia was a part) were threatened by the Turkish menace, they took away the bells and the silver and gold mass chalices and ritual utensils from the churches, they burned the mass coats in which the gold and silver threads were knitted, they introduced an anti-Turkish tax. The Tlacian Raj, as well as the local feudal lords, groaned under the weight of the burden imposed on them by the imperial office in Vienna. But we escaped the Turkish threat and the Ottoman yoke, with enormous human and material losses that would be felt for decades and centuries to come. So today, if we come together as we did in 1991, we are able to preserve the financial sovereignty of the R.S.S.R. Look, Greece has received and will receive more than €100 billion in aid (I don't know how it will pay it back, probably never! ). Its richest citizens alone have almost €200 billion invested in foreign banks. No comment is needed here. <p/> For me, the financial sovereignty of our country is not something that I would be prepared to sacrifice for. I am sure that the gentlemen from Brussels will manage our money better than our politicians do. As for the Greeks and their money, they are usually successful businessmen, and they are by no means stupid enough to buy in bulk the bonds of a country that is likely to go bankrupt within a few months. <p/> There are more than enough funds in the accounts of R Slovenia residents to sort things out (at least for now! ) on our own without asking for foreign help. But our citizens also have bank accounts in banks in Austria, Liechtenstein, etc. If everyone contributes as much as they can, the matter is solved. We can also guarantee our citizens the eventual sale of Telekom, Petrol, etc., so that they know that they will get their money back in any case. Bonds could be subscribed for at the counters of banks, post offices, administrative units, etc. This is not quite the same as buying treasury bills and the like. With my proposal, we would be buying our country's financial independence and, therefore, our future. Why have money in a sock or in the bank at 2% interest and know that you have done something good for yourself, your children and the whole country of R Slovenia by paying into the People's Loan. That's how it is. This should be an all-Slovenian action, like the signing of the May Day Declaration or something similar during the Austro-Hungarian period. But as I said, no one in state-owned or majority state-owned companies can have a salary higher than the President of the Republic, the Government, etc. (that's 65 pay grade). If we do not solve this problem too, we will have done nothing. There will always be leeches who will try to suckle at the state teat. I would not discuss the professionalism of these gentlemen, otherwise we would not be where we are, which is nowhere. The way they have run things, they would be any economics graduate who takes up his first job as a trainee. I think that he would have been driven by his profession and the professional challenge, whereas these gentlemen were driven solely by the drive for money. <p/> The Government regularly issues bonds. Any EU citizen or company can open a company here and buy the bonds mentioned in the proposal. So they would be no different from other bonds. This government, which is now "trying its best", has only recently blocked the much-needed reforms of the previous government through referendums.... in some cases practically the same laws as it is now proposing. Let's not forget this.... Given the way our politicians view the benefit of the state, in fact, coercive administration by Brussels seems to me to be a better idea by the day. As much damage as our own politicians are doing to us, those in Brussels certainly will not do it.
__label__objective Round table on the occasion of the Anti-Corruption Day: 'Municipal assets - a hub of corruption risks' <p/> 09.12.2015 <p/> On the occasion of the International Anti-Corruption Day, which is celebrated today with the slogan 'Let's break the chain of corruption', Mayor Marjan Šarec participated in a round table entitled 'Municipal assets - a hub of corruption risks'. The Commission for the Prevention of Corruption, which organised today's meeting, also presented an analysis of data from the integrity plans of Slovenian municipalities, which the Commission compared with data from its own database of municipal cases. <p/> The panellists discussed integrity plans, restrictions on the conduct of business and the disposal of assets, conflicts of interest, lobbying and undue influence, and talked about how they deal with and manage these issues in practice. <p/> In addition to Mayor Marjan Šarc, the participants included the President of the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption, Boris Štefanec, the Supreme State Auditor of the Court of Auditors, Mag.

__label__objective The School Fund is a fund intended to finance activities that are not part of the work of an educational establishment and are not financed from public funds. Its mission is to provide better conditions for our children to carry out their activities in kindergarten and school, in order to ensure their successful development. <p/> The Naklo Primary School School School Fund was established by the Naklo Primary School Council at its meeting on 22 May 2008, and the first regular meeting was held at the beginning of October 2008. The School Fund operates in accordance with the Rules on the operation and organisation of the Naklo Primary School School School Fund, which can be found on our website. <p/> The School Fund is managed by a Board of Directors, consisting of a Chairperson and six members, at least three of whom are representatives of the school (presumably the Headmaster, the Accountant and the School Community Mentor). The Parents' Council appoints the Board of Directors. The school representatives shall be nominated by the school council. The term of office of the members shall be two years, with the possibility of re-election. <p/> The School Fund receives its financial resources from contributions from parents and other citizens, donations, bequests and other sources such as charity events. Every month, many parents of kindergarten and primary school children contribute a "euro for a child" to the fund. This shows solidarity and the will of parents to afford their children a little more. We recommend ourselves to our loyal and new donors. Anyone who would like to support the projects of the School Fund with a donation can make a voluntary contribution to the special designated account of the School Fund - IBAN: SI56 0110 0600 8339 210, ref: 00-2990001. The Fund's resources have been and will be used exclusively for projects aimed at our children. The School Fund informs the Parent Council and the Board of the Institution about its operations. <p/> The Board of Directors has decided to continue the practice of using the financial resources of the Fund for projects that benefit not only the children currently in our kindergartens and schools, but also those who come after them. This is also the most transparent way of spending funds. <p/> In recent mandates, the following investments have been financed in whole or in part by the School Fund: - playground equipment for the playground at Podbrezje Primary School, - sails at Naklo Primary School and Mlinček Kindergarten, - wheelchairs for 6 children at Jelka Kindergarten and Mlinček Kindergarten, - gym mats for gymnastics, - seeds, seedlings and tools for the school garden, - alteration of the basket with regulation in the Naklo Primary School's gym, - skate-boards at the parent school and at the two branch schools, - arrangement of the outdoor classrooms, - a slide in the playground at the Naklo Primary School. <p/> We invite you to take a look at all the acquisitions in the 2020 photo gallery.<p/> Anja Mihelič, Chairperson of the Naklo Primary School Naklo School Fund Board, October 2020 <p/> By clicking on the attachments below you can view the minutes in MS Word or Adobe Reader.

__label__subjective Universiade already, but not at the expense of students! <p/> Eviction of students, accommodation for athletes? <p/> 10.1.2012 11:50:23 <p/> We are still a year away from the biggest winter event on the southern side of the Alps. We're talking about the 2013 Winter Universiade! <p/> From 30 January to 9 February 2013, Maribor will host one of the world's biggest winter sport events. A promising start has been followed by a number of problems, including the recent question of whether the Universiade will even take place in Maribor! Now there is also the question of where the 2500 participants will sleep. We can expect 1600 athletes and 850 accompanying persons at the UOC, plus a few other guests such as referees, FISU guests, volunteers, journalists... <p/> It is the wish of the Universiade 2013 company to accommodate most of the participants in the student halls of residence, mainly due to the high expectations and requirements of FISU regarding security and logistics. On the University of Maribor's side, however, the story is slightly different. They confirm that they have indeed discussed the issue, but they say that it was only a matter of arranging for volunteers to be accepted. "We only received the proposal to accommodate the Universiade participants from the Organising Committee in November last year, after the presentation of the FISU projects, when it became clear that the security costs and logistical problems would be too high with dislocated accommodation. We promised to look into this possibility, and we did," said Teodor Lorenčič, Head of the Promotion Centre at UM. The analysis showed that the student halls of residence could not provide more than 400 beds.

__label__objective Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that are usually transmitted through sexual contact. <p/> Formerly known as venereal diseases (syphilis, gonorrhoea, soft chancre and inguinal lymphogranuloma), STDs are now commonly divided according to the agents that cause them. <p/> General protection against STDs is abstinence, fidelity to two uninfected partners, or the use of barrier contraceptives, the best known of which is the condom. There is also a female version of the condom called femidon, but it is practically impossible to buy in Slovenia. <p/> The condom is the only contraceptive that both protects against the transmission of sexually transmitted pathogens and prevents unwanted pregnancy. <p/> The most common sexual infections are fungal and bacterial infections, which most often present in women as vaginal discharge, genital itching, burning pain when urinating. However, many sexually transmitted infections occur without any signs of infection or disease problems (asymptomatic infections). <p/> The possibility of infection should always be kept in mind when having sex. If sex is based on a good knowledge of the partner and mutual trust and fidelity, there is no risk of fresh infection. Of course, the risk is much higher with frequent changes of sexual partners and fleeting sexual contacts (promiscuous sexual behaviour). <p/> Some STIs are briefly described below, while HIV/AIDS, chlamydial infections and hepatitis are covered separately. <p/> Gonorrhoea (also gonorrhoea, thrips) Gonorrhoea is a widespread STD caused by gonococcus. It has seemingly, but unjustifiably, lost its importance due to the success and short duration of treatment. There is no data on the actual prevalence of gonorrhoea for Slovenia because the notification, which is compulsory, is incomplete. <p/> Gonorrhoea is sexually transmitted and mainly affects the genital organs. However, there is also gonorrhoea of the conjunctiva of newborn infants, which is contracted during childbirth if the parturient has gonorrhoea. Therefore, to prevent this type of infection, it is obligatory to protect every newborn with so-called Crede's drops at birth. It is also possible for gonococci to infect other sites outside the genitals and genital tract (buttocks, throat). In the male, after a short incubation period of a few days (i.e. the time between infection and the outbreak of the disease), a discharge from the urethra occurs, accompanied by itching and burning pain when urinating. After about 2 weeks, the acute inflammation becomes chronic. Complications of untreated gonorrhoea in a man include inflammation of the prostate, perimenopause and infertility. <p/> In women, there is virtually no disease in the initial period. There are no early signs of possible infection. <p/> Infection progresses to the internal reproductive organs (uterus, fallopian tubes), which can lead to infertility and ectopic pregnancy. <p/> Syphilis Syphilis is a contagious STD that can affect all organs of the human body. The causative agent of syphilis is a bacterium, Treponema pallidum. More than 95 infections are caused by having sex with an infected person. Non-sexual infections are caused by kissing, biting and other contact with a patient who has skin sores. <p/> Data on the prevalence of syphilis are fairly accurate, as the disease was considered the most severe STD due to its consequences until the emergence of HIV infection. In Slovenia, a dramatic increase in syphilis was recorded in 1994 and 1995 (36-38 per year), with a slight decline in the number of new cases in the following years. <p/> Syphilis is divided into early and late (duration up to 1 year or more than 1 year), and acquired and congenital, depending on how the infection occurred. <p/> The incubation period for syphilis is about 3 weeks. <p/> Early syphilis At the site of penetration of the bacterium into the skin or mucous membranes, a hard, hard-edged, round or oval ulcer forms after three days. The ulcer is most often on the genitals, but can also be on the lips or in the oral cavity. After a few days, the lymph nodes in the area swell, and after 2 months, most of the lymph nodes swell. Later, an itchy rash spreading from the trunk to the extremities appears, which spontaneously disappears after 1 to 2 months, leaving whitish patches. Several months after infection, hair loss may occur with coin-sized bald patches that grow back on their own. <p/> Late syphilis In this form, there are not necessarily changes in the skin, but there are changes in the blood vessels and central nervous system. The disease is proven and later controlled by detecting antibodies in the patient's blood or cerebrospinal fluid. <p/> Congenital syphilis A syphilitic infection in the mother can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth, or a child may be born with signs of syphilis. The last case of congenital syphilis in Slovenia was reported in 1986. <p/> It is important to detect syphilis as early as possible to prevent the spread of infection and to increase the success of treatment. The drug of choice is still penicillin. <p/> INFECTIONS WITH PAPILLOMA VIRUSES-GENITAL WARTS Some of the viruses belonging to the papillomavirus group cause genital warts (HPV 6 and HPV 11). The incubation period can be several months. The lesions themselves are harmless (benign), but they are very disturbing, uncomfortable, the treatment is long and painful, and recurrences are frequent. <p/> GENITAL HERPES Infection with herpes simplex type 2 is classified as an STD. The infection causes the formation of tiny vesicles on and around the genital area, which later become purulent. The vesicles appear in the presence of various triggering factors (immunosuppression, stress, illness, menstruation). <p/> Initially, there are only bubbles, but later small sores appear. <p/> Infection with the virus is permanent. If a pregnant woman who has a fresh infection gives birth to a child, she may be at high risk. If symptoms are present at the time of delivery, a caesarean section is performed to prevent infection of the newborn. <p/> Treatment of skin lesions is symptomatic. However, there are antiviral drugs that prevent the appearance of vesicles in people with a high incidence of genital herpes. These medicines are prescribed by a doctor. <p/> FUNGAL INFECTIONS Fungal infections of the genital tract are most commonly caused by fungi of the genus Candida, which are present in small numbers on mucous membranes. They often multiply on the mucous membranes of the female genital mucosa and are passed on during sexual intercourse. Men usually do not have problems, but may develop burning, reddish, partly whitish, penile rashes. <p/> In women, the genital area usually itches, the mucous membrane is red and there is a white, cheesy vaginal discharge. <p/> Creams and vaginal tablets are used for treatment. <p/> Pubic lice Pubic lice live on the hair of the genitals and are transmitted by sexual contact. Lice and nits are found on the hairs. Severe itching occurs. All infected persons must be treated and bed linen must be properly hygienised (wash at 95 degrees C). <p/> CHLAMIDIA INFECTIONS Data on the prevalence of chlamydia infections in Slovenia are unreliable. Despite the fact that it is compulsory to report the infection and that chlamydial infections are among the most common STDs, reporting is not practiced. Chlamydia are very small bacteria, sexually transmitted by Chlamydia trachomatis. <p/> In men, urethral and later perineal inflammation occurs after about 14 days after infection. However, an infected male may be without problems. <p/> Newborn babies become infected at birth if their mother has chlamydia cervicitis. Chlamydia eye inflammation and/or chlamydial pneumonia develop. <p/> The infection is treated with antibiotics. <p/> TRYHOMONIAZA Infection is caused by a protozoan, Trichomonas vaginalis. <p/> In men there is usually no problem, rarely there is inflammation of the urethral orifice and burning pain on urination. In women, after incubation for a few days, a foul-smelling, foamy vaginal discharge appears, accompanied by itching of the external genitalia and pain on urination.

__label__objective Today, the Minister of Culture, Majda Širca, opened the exhibition Drawing in Slovenia II 1940-2009 at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) in Zagreb, which presents the works of around 100 Slovenian artists. It is a selection of drawings from the exhibition of the same name, which was held last year at the City Gallery of Ljubljana. <p/> Drawing is one of the most daring, challenging and exciting genres within the field of art, because it confronts us with a very demanding and responsible gesture that we must not miss, a gesture that is unique and which, on the other hand, is often a matrix, a basis or a point of departure for other artistic practices, Širčeva said about the importance of drawings. These, she believes, have been lost, especially today, in the many postmodernist artistic genres. <p/> She stressed the importance of the exhibition for Slovenian art, as well as the outstanding cooperation with Croatia in the field of culture. The Croatian Minister of Culture, Bozo Biskupic, also pointed out at the opening that the Slovenian exhibition is a celebration of community and mutual understanding. He recalled that the three giants of Slovenian and European art - Zoran Mušić, Gabriel Stupica and Marij Pregelj - are a symbol of a common cultural centre, having studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb. <p/> It is the drawings of this trio that open the exhibition, said its curator and art historian Aleksandar Bassin, who said that drawing has never been a trendy exclusive. The exhibition, he said, is arranged according to the artists' ages, not their works. After the three artists mentioned, the works of selected artists follow, from sculptors and printmakers to painters of the middle generation. <p/> In the last part of the exhibition, there are young people who were born in the 1970s or 1980s, and it is they who, according to Bassin, most express the future of drawing, which is consciously and unencumbered living its full artistic life. <p/> Until 21 September, drawings created in various artistic techniques will be on display, providing both a representative insight into Slovenian artistic drawing of the last 70 years and the continuity of drawing as an independent chapter of Slovenian fine art. <p/> The Zagreb exhibition is also accompanied by a comprehensive monograph with interpretative critical commentaries on each artist.

Since the OLC is also - or mainly - a competition that is judged, and for which awards are even given at the end of the season in some categories, one would expect the participants to respect the basic principles of fair play. The IGC track is a blatant fraud; it cannot be understood or managed in any other way. In the next few days a valid G-record will become mandatory in all competition categories. This solution is not ideal, because some instruments do not make a G-record, and someone will probably be deprived because of this, but I do not see any other possibility.

__label__objective Doc. dr. Matjaž Ambrožič (* 1967), after graduating from the social science and language gymnasium and serving his military service, began his theological studies at the Faculty of Theology in Ljubljana in 1987. He was ordained a priest in 1993. He first worked as a chaplain in Kočevje (1993-1996) and in Novo mesto - Šmihel (1996-1996). In the autumn of 1997 he went to Rome to the Pontifical Gregorian University, where he completed his post-graduate studies at the Faculty of Church History and received his doctorate in 2002. Then he was a spiritual assistant in Vrhnika (2001 - 2004) and today he works in the parish of Ljubljana - Stožice (2004 -). He is engaged in scientific research and lecturing at the TEOF of the University of Ljubljana and at its Unit in Maribor (assistant 2001, assistant professor 2004). His scientific and research activity is devoted to the field of local church and world history, as well as art history. He also spends a lot of time studying archival material. The results of Ambrožič's scientific research activity are mainly scientific monographs and treatises: - Bell Ringing in Slovenia, AES 15 (1993) - Il ruolo ecclesiastico, culturale e politico di dott. Janez Zlatoust Pogačar (1811-1884), Principe-vescovo di Lubiana, nella storia degli Sloveni, Roma 2002 - The Bishop of Ljubljana, Dr. Janez Zlatoust Pogačar. His religious, cultural and political role in the history of Slovenians, AES 25 (2003) - The parish church of the conversion of St. Paul in Vrhnika, Vrhnika 2002 - The parish church of St. Fabijan and St. Boštjan and St. Jernej in Kočevje and its branches, Kočevje 2003. A semi-scientific approach is also characteristic of Ambrožič's two professional monographs. New bells in the parish church of St Martin, Srednja vas v Bohinju, Ljubljana 2000 and St George and St Lenart in Ligojna, Vrhnika 2004. The most important of his treatises is Die kirchliche Entwicklung nach den politischen Veränderungen (1990) und die heutige Stellung der Kirche, statistische Angaben, Organisation der Kirche (1990) und die heutige Stellung der Kirche, statistische Angaben, Organisation der Kirche), in Die katholische Kirche in Mitteleuropa nach 1945 bis zur Gegenwart (The Catholic Church in Mitteleuropa nach 1945 bis zur Gegenwart), ed. Jan Mikrut, Dom-Verlag, Wien 2006, pp. 531-604, which he wrote as an associate of the Internationales Forschungsinstitut zur Förderung der Kirchengeschichte in Mitteleuropa, Vienna. Associate Professor Matjaž Ambrožič, PhD, is an expert (co-author) in the field of bell- and organ-building, and a writer of expert reports on the restoration and purchase of bells and organs. In the field of bell-ringing he cooperates with the Beratungsausschuß für Deutsche Glockenwesen.
__label__subjective Yeah, I find it ugly too that I have to explain why I'm single, I just haven't found a guy yet who doesn't enjoy sex.Since I don't really enjoy sex at all I don't think it's anything special as far as I've gotten to know it so far.Otherwise I'm not of the engaging variety it's hard to find a thing that engages me that only the male organ does.Yes it's possible that there's stress in between but at the same time I don't see myself tied down and let's say married <p/> You're "lucky" that ONLY the male sex organ engages you. I get it all the time (doolg). Finding an asexual partner is also difficult, I think, because a lot of them wouldn't admit to being that way for the world. <p/> Yes it is true that men's pride suffers when they admit it.I myself have a great desire to become a mother one day but again my orientation or sense of sexuality is the problem.How will I become a mother if I don't enjoy sexual pleasures <p/> I guess it will depend on what kind of relationship you have with the man you are going to be a couple with. I didn't find it difficult at first because I was very much in love. That's why I have two children anyway. I didn't feel physical pleasure, but the emotional closeness was a good balance. But when the love died, I couldn't even kiss anymore. In the last few years, I can't even imagine touching anymore. Hugging a friend - that's still a thing. But the rest of it eludes me. I'm not happy that it's like this, but you get used to it (what else is there to do) and you get used to it. <p/> Sorry, maybe you didn't mean it that way, but that's what I think is wrong. Knowing that you don't want a long term partnership and sex, but still finding someone and lying to them until you get pregnant is just not OK. Pippa's case is ok because she only found out later and did not knowingly lie - and she and her ex-partner probably suffered a lot during the divorce. I understand where you are coming from, because it does not seem fair to me either that I will probably not be able to have a 'normal' family and children. But even heterosexual people often have problems finding a suitable partner. But you can use knowing yourself and your expectations to create the kind of relationship you really want. If you find an asexual partner or donor, you can also get pregnant without direct sexual contact. <p/> Yeah, the donor option is also an option and it's probably going to have to be a bit over the pond when the clock is ticking because I really want to be a mum one day and yeah, it would be really nasty to have a boyfriend just to get pregnant, so I'm really going to have to get into action in a couple of years and find an asexual partner to get emotionally involved with or a donor <p/> Yeah, it's really difficult and I guess if I find a man to live with I'd have to have the talk.But most of all I want to have a child in a few years time without having to have sex.I am fed up of telling my mum that I only see myself with a child without a man maybe that sounds selfish to have a child without a father so the real one gets a boyfriend go to bed when you get pregnant get rid of him.She doesn't even understand that I am repulsed by the thought of having sex <p/> It doesn't sound selfish to me. There have always been single women who have been without a man. If they can take good care of a child, then I don't think it's selfish. What I think is selfish is lying to your partner and only being with him until you get pregnant. <p/> white wrote: <p/> She doesn't even understand that the thought of sex is repulsive to me <p/> Maybe she should talk to her mother. Mine took time to accept me though. However, she is now OK with the idea that I am asexual and that I don't want a sexual partnership. I also want to have a child and I don't know how that will happen one day. But I don't bother about that. It will be what it will be. <p/> Yes, it really doesn't make sense to lie to a man just to get pregnant.In my own words, my greatest wish is to become a mother without having to go to bed and to raise a child on my own, otherwise a woman can play the role of both mother and father <p/> Yes, it is really unpleasant if parents have their own views on parenting and I know how it is for a child if he doesn't know which way to go with whom he should stick with.I am single and probably will be single with a child I have already looked into the possibility of insemination without intercourse a little and it looks good so when the time comes I will be able to have a child.Just today my mother shocked me by saying that I should bring a boyfriend to a party in six months so that I won't be a black sheep in the eyes of my relatives, so that I can say I have a boyfriend just to shut them up <p/> Just today my mother shocked me by saying, that I should bring a boyfriend to a party in six months' time so that I won't be a black sheep in the eyes of my relatives, so that I can say I have a boyfriend just to shut them up <p/> Sad. Obviously your mum cares more about what people will think of you (and your mum) than what you really want. Social pressures are a terrible thing and I hope you manage to stay true to yourself. I hope you have a supportive environment in which you feel accepted regardless of your asexual feelings. Without that, it can be extremely tiring

__label__subjective Use your face instead of a joystick! <p/> Until now, online game players have been using a joystick, mouse and keyboard - what if you could use your face to control the game for a change? This cool new idea is now available for the first time in the form of Red Bull Formula Face - turn on your webcam, relax your facial and neck muscles, tilt your head, blink and take the first turn with turbo acceleration. <p/> The new online game is based on the latest technology, where you use your face to navigate around the track. It's a world premiere. The user uses a webcam to track their facial expressions. The game is free, suitable for both PC and Mac, does not need to be downloaded to your computer and can be tested at www.redbullformulaface.com. <p/> Red Bull Formula Face does away with the joystick altogether. It used to be about the player's manual dexterity to win or lose, but now all you need is a webcam and your face. A wink to turbo acceleration and a head tilt to cornering? It's easy with Red Bull Formula Face. You're just a few steps away from your first interactive race: turn on the webcam, choose your favourite character, personalise it with your own photo, choose a Formula 1, NASCAR or rally car and your personal avatar is ready to go! There are three different levels to battle against the computer. <p/> The facial control technology developed for Red Bull Formula Face is both simple and revolutionary: tilt your head left or right to manoeuvre your car on the track. The aim of the game, which has a paper-like appearance, is to score as many points as possible. Flicking your eyes triggers turbo accelerations that can leave your opponent in a puff of smoke. You can activate the add-ons you collect during the game at any time, and they give you a decisive advantage: a pair of wings to propel you far forward, monster tyres to run over your opponent, or glue and scissors to stop them. <p/> Photo bonuses give you lots of extra points and guaranteed laughs: they start as soon as you hit one of the cameras hovering over the track. They reward the player who mimics the facial expressions shown as closely as possible. You can save the photos you take to your Red Bull Formula Face profile and share them with your friends on Facebook. The result of the last race is also posted - and you can bet that your friends will race to beat you and post the craziest photos they can. For those who are good at handwork, you can download a PDF of your avatar and build an origami racer to take to the table. <Stefan Becker from BUZZIN MONKEY, the company responsible for the concept and creation of Red Bull Formula Face, had this to say about the innovative new game: "For the first time ever, you can control the game without any special hardware such as a console or joystick - all you need is your face and facial expressions - and it's all tightly integrated with the social network. "Red Bull Formula Face is available in multiple languages and can be played worldwide. <p/> Let's face it - joysticks are a thing of the past - facial expressions are the future! So put on your racing face and visit www.redbullformulaface.com for the very first experience of playing an online game using facial expressions. <p/> What exactly do they do? Don't worry, they're not crazy, they're playing Red Bull Formula Face - the first online game where you control your car with your facial expressions - smiling activates special effects, if you shut up,...
__label__objective Today's issue of Novi tednik publishes a vacancy for the director of the public institution Zdravstveni dom Šmarje pri Jelšah, which operates in the area of the six municipalities of Obsotelje and Kozjansko. The search for a new director has been going on since last May, when the long-standing director, doctor Janko Čakš, did not receive the consent of the municipal councils of all the municipalities co-founding the public institution.... <p/> He did not get the consent of Rogaška Slatina and Podčetrtek, which complained about a shortage of doctors, so in October the council of the institution adopted a new decision on the tender for the director. Before the end of the year, a candidate from Kamnik was selected as director, but later resigned. Janko Čakš is currently acting as Director, which can last for up to a year. After the candidates have applied for today's call for tenders, the Tender Committee will submit a report on the candidates to the Board, which is expected to decide on the appointment of the Director at its first meeting next year. In this case, the consent of all the co-founding municipalities is expected to follow.
__label__subjective Bullshit detector! <p/> Ekola, they told me to write a blogpost about something that happened at the conference! The most interesting talk, in my opinion, was given by Gustav Martner, Executive Creative Director of CP+B Europe (Crispin Porter + Bogusky Europe) <p/> Mr. Martner lectured about advertising, internet, media, his mom, cable TV, kids, about how the microphone crashes - yes it's true, a couple of times the microphone failed while he was lecturing, but what I liked the most was that he got the audience on his side when he said that the microphone is a bullshit detector (for those who don't count, the microphone stops working when Gustav is loading the microphone). Audience relaxed, attention gained. <p/>What did he say about the Internet as a medium? To sum it up in a few lines and a few more photos. I would like to point out that, in general, the conference did not discover hot water, as they say, in fact they did not say anything so new, but they presented it in an interesting way. This applies to the minority of lectures in English! Unfortunately, I do not know if they said anything more specific in the Spanish-speaking lecture theatres. <p/> Gustav Martner during his lecture <p/> Let's have a slide to rest your eyes, and I'll rest my fingers: <p/> Why don't sales people like this? - Because technology is democratising (it's available to most people) - Because digital distribution is democratising (it's available to most people) - Because anyone can be an agent (an ambassador for a product) - Because dialogue and conversation are being mass-produced - Because control is increasingly being lost <p/> The creativity of the advertising product, the culture it creates, is no longer as controllable as it used to be. <p/> Does this mean that traditional media such as TV, radio or print, as well as conventional online advertising, have a competitive opponent? Does it mean that there is an end to the traditional advertisements that are collected from a few people and that are advertised with the brute force of online or offline marketing? For such campaigns, we have to pay a lot of money, we call it 'bought media' - because we have paid to have a new product flogged to us on the web! <p/> Gustav Martner says NO! NOT AT ALL! <p/> He proved it with the example of Burger King T-shirts, just look at the Gustav Martner - OMExpo Madrid slides. If it is good advertizing, it is quickly used by the onlinecommunity and the issue goes viral! Which is genius! Two things are the only things that matter! <p/> The first is that there is no such control over what goes viral. It takes good foresight and planning to offer the communitiy what you want them to grab. Bait! ;) The second is that clients are afraid of the negative image and connotation of the product or service that viral content would bring.
__label__objective The Core <p/> If at the time of entering into the contract of conveyance the conveyancer was aware of the legal consequences of entering into the contract of conveyance and had the will to enter into the contract of conveyance, the conveyancer will be deemed to have had the capacity at the time of entering into the contract of conveyance to enter into such a contract. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> The appeal is allowed and the judgment of the Court of First Instance is modified so that the defendants are obliged to issue to the plaintiff, within 15 days, a land registration deed on the basis of which the plaintiff will be entitled to register the land in respect of the immovable properties No 83 of the Land Register No D. and No 756 of the Land Register No D. and No 756 of the Land Register No D. on their co-ownership interests, in order to register the title in his own name, since such a deed would otherwise be superseded by the present judgment, and to reimburse him, within 15 days, the costs of the proceedings before the Court of First Instance, amounting to EUR 5 930,52, with interest at the statutory rate of late payment, with effect from the 16th day following the date of receipt of the present decision, in the event of delay. <p/> The defendants are ordered to reimburse to the applicant, within 15 days, EUR 1 572,03 of the costs of the appeal, with interest at the statutory rate from the 16th day following receipt of this decision until payment. <By the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action for the issue of a land registry deed in respect of immovable properties No 83 of the Land Register of D. and No 756 of the Land Register of D. in the applicant's name, finding that the contract of conveyance of 19 September 1994 between the conveyancer, Mrs I.F., and the applicant was null and void. It is void because, at the time of the conclusion of the contract of assignment, Mrs F. was not capable of understanding the meaning and consequences of the contract of assignment (she lacked capacity to act). <p/> 2. Against the judgment of the Court of First Instance, the applicant appeals on all the grounds set out in Article 388(1) of the Civil Procedure Act, seeking an amendment of the judgment so as to uphold the claim, and, in the alternative, to set aside the judgment and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial. The appeal challenges the finding of the Court of First Instance that, at the time of the conclusion of the contract of assignment, Mrs I.F. was not capable of understanding the meaning and consequences of the contract of assignment. Ms F's capacity to act is presumed and the defendants have not challenged that presumption. The mere existence of the disease of senile dementia is not proof that she did not understand the meaning of the contract of assignment. Expert B. was of the opinion that there was an 80 % probability that Mrs F.I. did not understand the meaning of the contract of assignment. On the basis of that expert's opinion, the presumption of the existence of Ms I. F.'s capacity to act is not rebutted. In the light of the circumstances, Mrs I.F.'s capacity was more or less preserved and she is able to express what she wants to do with her assets. <p/> 3. In their reply to the application, the defendants submit that a piecemeal, piecemeal assessment of the evidence cannot lead to the desired result that Ms I.F. had the capacity to act at the time of the signing of the contract of assignment. The Court of First Instance is autonomous in its assessment of the evidence. The emphasis on the bright moments of the handing-over of Mrs I.F. cannot be placed in the timeframe of the conclusion of the handing-over contract, since, apart from the date of conclusion of the handing-over contract, we do not know what state of mind Mrs F.I. was in when she concluded the handing-over contract. Expert B.B. did not conclude that Mrs F. I. was in a lucid phase at the time of the conclusion of the contract. Mrs F.'s will was not entirely free, as it was quite suggestible, but the proceedings have not proceeded in that direction so far because the parties have not claimed that it was. The expert, Mr B.B., did not speculate. He confirmed that his findings were correct, which means that I.F. was incompetent at the time of the conclusion of the contract of delivery. The plaintiff did not attend the hearings, which suggests that there was something wrong with the contract from the outset. <p/> 4. The Court of Appeal questioned the correctness of the Court of First Instance's assessment of the evidence and therefore held a main hearing, at which it repeated the evidence of the expert Dr Z. Č. At the time of the conclusion of the contract of delivery on 19 September 1994, Mrs F. was of legal age and therefore presumed to have had the capacity to act. It is for the defendant to prove that at the time of the conclusion of the contract of entrustment she lacked capacity, that she did not understand the meaning of the conclusion of the contract of entrustment and that she lacked the capacity to form the will to conclude the contract of entrustment. <p/> On the basis of the expert opinions of Dr. Z. Č. T. and Dr B.B., the testimony of the witness J.B. and the actions of I.F. after the conclusion of the contract of assignment (her statement at the Centre for Social Work Jesenice on 12.10.1994, the conclusion of the lease agreement on 14.12.1994 and the consequences of the dementia from which I.F. suffered), the Court of First Instance concluded that I.F. did not understand the nature of the contract which she had concluded with the claimant on 19.09.1994 and its legal consequences. The Court of Appeal takes a different view of that evidence, in particular because the experts fundamentally misinterpreted the statement made by Mrs F. before the Centre for Social Work Jesenice on 12.10.1994 and incorrectly linked that statement to the lease agreement concluded between Mrs F. and the applicant on 14.12.1994. <p/> It is clear from Ms F.'s statement of 12.10.1994 that she was aware that she had already handed over the property to the applicant (I myself wanted D.J. to have everything I had). I want him to have all my property after my death, or rather to have it already now. I.F. was also aware of why she was giving her property to the claimant, because he takes care of her and will continue to take care of her in the future (because he takes care of me, he is very good and I think he will continue to do so in the future). <p/> She also testified that her relatives are not interested in her or that they come to help her when they can and that they cannot come often. It follows from this statement that she wanted the continued assistance which the applicant had provided and had undertaken to provide in the future. <p/> It follows from Mrs F.'s statement that she understood the meaning of the contract of delivery of 19.09.1994, that she was handing over all her property to the applicant, and that she wished to enter into such a contract of delivery, that is to say, to form a business will to enter into such a contract, on the ground that the applicant would take care of her in the future. <p/> The experts' view that it is not logical that, after the conclusion of the contract of conveyance, I.F. and the applicant also concluded a lease contract on 14.12.1994 for an apartment on the first floor of the house is not justified, since at the time of the conclusion of the lease contract the contract of conveyance had not yet been registered in the land register and therefore the applicant had not become the land registry owner of the property conveyed. The conclusion of the lease contract is therefore a logical act, since by concluding it the applicant acquired the legal title to live in the house. When it was suggested to the experts that the conclusion of the lease agreement was logical, they replied that this was a legal view, not a psychiatric one. The court is not persuaded by such an answer of the experts. The logic of the transactions entered into is interpreted in terms of the need to enter into those transactions. Since the plaintiff had not yet acquired the legal title to live in the I.F. house by the mere conclusion of the contract of delivery, and the procedure for obtaining the status of farmer for the plaintiff had been delayed, it is logical and understandable that the plaintiff secured the right to live in the I.F. house by concluding the lease. <p/>Expert Dr. Z. Č. T. and Dr B. B. thus erred in considering that the subsequent conclusion of the lease contract implies that Mrs I.F. was not aware of the meaning of the contract of handover and that she was not capable of forming the will to enter into the contract of handover. The experts' request that Mrs F. should have stated in her statement of 12 October 1994 that she had already concluded the contract of usufruct is too strict, but in her statement Mrs F. testified to the essential elements of the contract of usufruct, namely that the property was already in the possession of the applicant and that the latter would take care of it in the future. <p/> Since it is clear from Mrs F.'s deposition of 12.10.1994 that she was aware of the importance of the contract of conveyance and that she wished to enter into it, it can be safely concluded that she also had such a wish on 19.09.1994, when she concluded the contract of conveyance. That will or capacity was not affected by her illness, dementia of old age, particularly in the light of the report on her state of health by Dr J.K. of 15.11.1994, in which he responded to enquiries made by the Centre for Social Work concerning the state of I.F.'s health. in which he stated that she was oriented in terms of personality, location and time, and the letter of 22.11.1994 from the nurse responsible for her care, Ms J.B., in which she stated that she had visited Ms I.F. four times since March 1994 and that she considered her to be of sound mind and health for her age. However, at the hearing on 19.11.2007, J.B. testified that she remembered I.F. as a confused, demented person who could no longer look after herself and needed help. When J.B.'s letter of 22.11.1994 was read to her, she stated that she remembered the case well at the time, but today she remembers I.F. as she described her at the hearing. It should be borne in mind that she had visited her 10 times, i.e. that she had continued to visit her even after she had made her statement of 22.11.1994. Her statement at the hearing is therefore not contradicted by the letter of 22.11.1994, it is only the timeframe to which the statement refers that is relevant. It follows from the statement of 22.11.1994 that this statement refers to the time up to the date of the statement, whereas the statement at the hearing on 09.11.2007 refers to the entire memory of her. <p/> Expert B.B. explained that confusion in dementia occurs in intervals of varying length, which means that a person with dementia is not mentally confused between the intervals. He was of the opinion that I.F. did not understand the meaning of the contract of conveyance at the time of the conclusion of the contract of conveyance, which he gave with a probability of 80 %. Such an opinion by Dr B.B. does not, therefore, rebut the presumption that Mrs F. had capacity at the time of the conclusion of the handover contract of 19 September 1994. For that reason, it is also not possible to follow the opinion of the expert Z. Č. T., that at the time of the conclusion of the handover contract I.F. was incapable of understanding the meaning of the handover contract, since both opinions are based on the same assessment of the facts, only that they ultimately assess them differently. <p/> As regards the testimony of the other parties and witnesses, it should be made clear that they gave their testimony as they saw and perceived it when they were in contact with Ms I.F.. However, in view of her illness, age-related dementia, which occurs at intervals, this may have been in a phase of confusion or in a phase of lucidity and therefore cannot affect the assessment of the evidence itself, given that it can be concluded with certainty from her statement before the Social Work Centre on 12.10.1994 that she was aware of the significance of the handover contract and that she had the will to form the basis of such a handover contract of 19.09.1994. <p/> 7. The amendment of the judgment affects the amendment of the decision on costs. The applicant was successful in the proceedings and must therefore reimburse the defendants for the costs of the proceedings before the Court of First Instance, which are assessed at a total of EUR 5 930,52 (EUR 3 474,83 for the costs of legal representation and EUR 2 474,83 for the costs of the lawyer).455,69 for fees, expert fees and travel costs), and to reimburse him EUR 1 572,03 in respect of the costs of the appeal (EUR 492,60 in respect of the appeal fee, EUR 407,59 in respect of the costs of drafting the notice of appeal, EUR 331,58 in respect of the costs of attending the main hearing on 14 February 2011 and EUR 340,26 in respect of the costs of the expert). <p/> The defendants shall pay the costs of the proceedings to the applicant within 15 days, with default interest at the statutory rate from the 16th day following receipt of this decision.

__label__objective Funeral vehicles <p/> 01/11/2013 <p/> Andrej Godeša Photo and sources.<p/> Some people go to heaven after death, others at least want to go to outer space <p/> People have always believed in an afterlife. In preparation for their final journey, they once prepared a more or less lavish journey depending on their status in society and the extent of their wealth. Often, so many grave goods were accumulated that a means of transport was used for the final journey, especially if the distance to the resting place was somewhat greater. The tradition has survived almost unchanged to the present day. People plan their final journey using a wide variety of means of transport. <p/> Funeral rituals have of course changed over the millennia, but the essence has remained the same. Human remains had to be buried, burned, immersed or otherwise disposed of. Both out of respect for the dead and the belief that the grave is only a way station on the road to eternity, and for purely practical reasons. By removing the corpse, they prevented beasts from coming near the dwellings, and they removed the source of the unpleasant stench of putrefaction and the risk of spreading infectious diseases. As human society evolved, status symbols soon appeared. Even after death, the high-ranking did not want to give them up, as best evidenced by the building of the pyramids. Rulers were escorted to their final resting place in ornate stretchers, chariots or ships. They were stocked with everything necessary for the mighty to live in the next life. In 323 BC, a funeral chariot with the first simple buffers was used to transport the golden sarcophagus containing the remains of Alexander the Great to Alexandria. Handcarts and horse-drawn carts became the main funerary vehicle for the next few millennia. After the invention of cannons in the 13th century and their gradual increase in size, a variation of this transport became the cannon laffete, a wheeled base for carrying cannons, on which the coffins of military leaders and officers were placed. It was only in the 19th century, with the introduction of the steam engine and the building of railways, that the body of the deceased was occasionally carried by train, while carriages continued to rule the short distances. In some large American cities, special subway cars were built for this purpose, but they did not "catch on". Perhaps the world's most famous rail journey was in 1865, when a steam train was used to transport US President Abraham Lincoln on his last journey from Washington, where he was assassinated. The body of the great leader who united Americans divided by the Civil War and abolished slavery was transported by a mourning train through several states to Illinois, where he was buried in a tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery. Closer to us in time and place is the final journey of former Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito, who was transported by train from Ljubljana, where he died in 1980, across much of Yugoslavia to Belgrade, where he is buried in a tomb at Dedinje. With the invention of the electric motor, the internal combustion engine and the automobile, new possibilities emerged for transporting the coffin from the deceased's home or hospital to the mortuary and on to the church, where a farewell service was held, and then on the final journey to the grave. It took almost half a century before motorised hearses became established, before engines became sufficiently powerful and, above all, reliable and quiet. The first mention of motorised hearses dates back to 1907, when a hearse with a built-in electric motor was introduced in Paris. Two years later, a petrol-engined hearse was built in the USA, but it was not until the 1920s that it became widely used. In the first period, especially during the First World War, the same vehicles were used for transporting the wounded and sick as well as for transporting bodies, but almost everywhere the basic purpose of the vehicle was soon separated by the choice of equipment fitted. In some rural areas of the USA, such combination vehicles were still in use in the second half of the last century. Because of the lower frequency of funeral transport, the vehicle was used as an ambulance to transport the wounded, and for the transport of the dead, the vehicle was decorated with curtains and flowers and other decorations before the journey and the vehicle was done. It was not until 1979 that such combinations were banned by US federal law. Most of the vehicles used for funerals are prestigious makes. This way, the deceased gets to ride in a luxury vehicle at least once (if not for life) after death. Maybe they use prestigious vehicles for this purpose more because of the relatives who would be embarrassed if the coffin was driven in a cheap car. In Europe, the most common funeral vehicles today are those based on Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Opel, Ford and, of course, in some places the legendary Rolls Royce or Daimler, while in the USA Cadillac and Lincoln are the leading models, and in Asia Mitsubishi, Toyota and Nissan. The production of hearse vehicles usually takes place in two phases. First, the chassis with the engine and the front section with the driving compartment are mass-produced in the factory, then the vehicle is finished by specialised coachbuilders who slightly reinforce the chassis and the brakes and equip the vehicle according to the wishes and fantasies of the final customer, the funeral company. Today, most funeral vehicles are made by converting station wagons from standard vehicles. Given the "light work" involved, these vehicles can last for decades with regular maintenance, so that specialist companies replace them more out of prestige than out of necessity. A few main styles of funeral vehicle fitting have become established around the world. These are usually the classical approach, which has survived from the carriages, which were richly upholstered with plush and curtains, or the limousine approach, where the vehicles are fitted with as many ornate glass surfaces as possible, which are inserted between the supporting pillars. In some parts of Asia, funeral vehicles try to emulate as closely as possible the classical forms of Buddhist temples, decorated with ornate, often gilded, decoration. More recently, in the desire for individuality and originality, some funeral companies have started to use more unusual combinations of vehicles for their clients' final journeys. In the UK, keen motorcyclists may choose a motorcycle with a sidecar to carry the coffin or the urn with the ashes on the final journey. They have come up with something similar with a tricycle and trailer. For those who are in a particular hurry to get to heaven (or more likely hell), they have produced a "hot rod" vehicle across the puddle with the symbolic number "666" on the door. In some parts of the world, boats are still used for funerals. At the turn of the 21st century, another wish of science and technology lovers has come true, and at the same time we have a new funeral vehicle - the space rocket. In the spring of 1997, the Pegasus rocket flew, carrying the ashes of 24 people who wanted to be astronauts, at least after death, and who could afford it, on its journey into space. The modified rocket, with lipstick-sized grills, orbited the Earth in an elliptical orbit for the next five years until it fell back in spring 2002. Among the "passengers" were Gene Roddenberry, screenwriter of the science-fiction film series "Star Trek", and Timothy Leary, a psychologist and futurist, best known for his ideas on the therapeutic effects of the drug LSD in the early 1960s. The next flight was the first real space funeral. The "Lunar Prospector" probe, which carried not only instruments but also a sample of the famous astronomer's ashes, landed on the Moon. Eugene Shoemaker (discoverer of the comet of the same name), the first man to be buried on the Moon, arrived there in the summer of 1999. In the following years, the death rocket flew several more times and has carried the remains of some 660 people into space to date. Among them are several famous people, such as astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the planet Pluto in the 1930s, James Doohan, better known as Scotty in the "Star Trek" film series, and Leroy Gordon Cooper, a member of the first US space expedition (Project Mercury) in the early 1960s.

__label__subjective A future without traffic lights <p/> Virtual Traffic Sign. Scientists predict the future extinction of traffic lights at intersections. Virtual traffic officers are expected to ensure the smooth flow of vehicles at intersections. In the video, it all looks chaotic. <p/> In the future, according to scientist Peter Stone, passengers will sit in the back of their cars and read the newspaper, use the computer or just enjoy the ride, with the car taking over the driving role and, thanks to virtual traffic lights, moving seamlessly through intersections without traffic lights in cities. <p/> "Computers already reliably fly passenger planes like trained pilots, but driving cars remains a risky activity. We are working to ensure that vehicles can replace the driver in as many driving segments as possible. As autonomous vehicles become popular, we will integrate them into urban transport," Stone reports. <p/> You can see what the intersections of the future should look like in the video above by Peter Stone and his students.
__label__subjective IBM's $34 billion takeover of Red Hat is done. Which direction will the two companies go in the future? <p/> Last year's announcement of IBM's takeover of Red Hat raised many eyebrows and many people started to wonder with scepticism what would happen to Red Hat. The deal is now closed and it is now time to answer the questions on a practical level and not just in principle. <p/> So - IBM is looking to Red Hat to help it increase its annual turnover over the next five years, mainly, of course, from hybrid cloud. But does this mean that Red Hat's technology will leave the open source waters? No. The open source approach remains. And not only that, Paul Cormier, one of the company's CEOs, told ZDnet that "the development journey on steroids is now beginning". <p/> And what else will be new/old? More at the link below, just briefly here: <p/> Red Hat will maintain open source development and independence within IBM, <p/> Red Hat will be a separate entity within IBM, and organisationally will be part of the Cloud and Cognitive Software division, <p/> Red Hat employees can contribute and participate in open source projects outside Red Hat, as they do today, <p/> The Red Hat Developer programme - including the website, blog and social media channels - will remain independent, and Developer participants "will continue to enjoy free access to Red Hat services, software downloads, ebooks, events and other content". <p/> IBM and Red Hat will run separate partner programmes and cultivate separate partner ecosystems, <p/> It all sounds pretty mind-boggling, especially the part about keeping Red Hat independent. Obviously, IBM has also learnt something from deals like the Lotus acquisition.

Of these, not one voted for the conservative Forward Italy. However, at least five voters voted for the mayoral candidate of that party, who was also supported by other right-wing parties. The centre-left's main mayoral candidate, meanwhile, received 19 votes. <p/> Berlusconi was sentenced to a year in prison last year for tax evasion in the Mediaset case. As he is over 70 years old, he does not have to serve his sentence in prison, so a Milan court ordered him to carry out community service in mid-April.

__label__subjective T=0°C and snowing, small to medium snowflakes are falling quite densely, so the grass is white and the roads are starting to stick. I'm predicting max and very optimistic 5 cm of snow by this morning (the 30 we talked about on Thursday is like some kind of fatamorgana in the desert). I'm happy to see that at least I'm seeing snow and this isn't a complete fiasco and a hoax by the models, because then I'd be seriously questioning what's the point of all this looking at charts when it's all blowing up like a soap bubble practically in front of my nose. The ARSO should also be commended for not falling under the euphoria like us young snow-lovers and then having noses 5x longer than the height of the snow cover, the last 5-10 cm of which I immediately subscribe to! <p/> Logged in <p/> Rosi T=1,4°C here we are practically done with the precipitation,it's all going too far south.At the end of the precipitation it just snowed for a few minutes,but to no effect. <p/> From Velenje, the illuminated transmitter at Urška is visible, and the fog has already risen to over 1200 mnm even on the Mozir mountains <p/> All I saw today that was similar to snow were a few more dense raindrops between Celje and Arja vasja at around 20:00, but otherwise just rain! <p/> Once again we stayed with long noses this year... <p/> Well, yes... it stopped raining (I put my car out in the rain and at least it washed off), I didn't see a single snowflake, I don't even know what the snowy surroundings of my home look like anymore,... but it could have been worse. It could have rained up to 1800m.a.s.l............................................... <p/> Maybe the precipitation mentioned above really will come to us... <p/> .. like us young snow lovers and then have noses 5x longer than the snow cover... <p/> That is to say, noses are no longer than before because 5 x 0cm = 0 <p/> Otherwise, here at +2.0°C and 98% RH, it is still raining lightly. No snowflakes in sight yet. They will come soon... but unfortunately too late. <p/> No sign of snow here either, it has stopped raining, I hope that's not all because the temperature is still dropping and it's 3.1. It's true that 14mm of rain fell, but somehow I was expecting more intense precipitation when I saw the maps! <p/> I'm really glad that at least the interior got snow, because otherwise I would have been lynched by my colleagues when I predicted snow in the forecast below. Oh, and Vrhnika will be at least a little bit white by tomorrow, and Logatec is already a little bit white, judging by the DARS pictures. <p/> Good night. <p/> Anyway, it's not a complete hoax, but it was close to it. <p/> Forecast Saturday, 02 February 2008 Latest weather models indicate a marginal snow situation in the lowlands of continental Slovenia. Wet snow may fall in the lowlands and will mainly melt. The greatest chance of snow cover in the lowlands is in the areas of Kočevje, Cerknica, Logatec, Postojna, Novo mesto and Snežnik and surroundings. There, between 5 and 10 cm of snow may fall under favourable conditions. In most parts of the country, snow is certain to fall at 500 metres above sea level or higher, especially during the night on Sunday, by which time it will have weakened and gradually stopped in the north and east of the country. <p/> What's up, they've got the models right Here it starts to mix with snow from 450m upwards, around Senožeč and Razdrteg it snows, but it doesn't stick...only about 50m higher up it starts. The intensity is terrible. Heavy precipitation over the Adriatic, Kvarner and Friuli. Temp here is +2.9, so that with suitable precipitation it would turn around later... so only storm with gusts around 50km/h, Podnanos even up to 80km/h Today 25.6mm fell. <p/> Žiri, temperature 0.9°C, snowing. A little higher it is white, but there is no "force". Well, yes, at least there will be something for an artistic impression, but if not sooner, next time.

__label__objective Description: Intensive industrial agriculture, as the second largest polluter of the environment, is increasingly subject to public pressure for sustainable agricultural production. There are no indicators to assess the sustainability of the production system (PS) as a whole. The aim of this thesis was to design and evaluate a tool for sustainability assessment of arable (wheat, spelt and oil pumpkin) and vegetable (cabbage and beetroot) production in four CS (conventional - CON, integrated - INT, organic - ECO and biodynamic - BD), using data from a field experiment at FKBV in the 2008 season. The Sustainable Process Index ® (SPI) for agriculture calculates the environmental footprint in m2 of all direct and indirect inputs used during production. The analysis shows that the differences between the PS are large, and the partial results of the environmental footprint indicate where improvements are needed during the production process. The environmental footprint was highest in the KON (total 3,005,108.9 m2) and lowest in the control (642,906.2 m2), the reference PS, for all the crops observed. Wheat had the largest environmental footprint in the KON (792,646.8 m2) and oil pumpkin the smallest in the control (113,334.7 m2) PS. The calculated environmental performance index (environmental footprint per unit of yield - kg) confirmed the SPI trend in most cases. The SPI is a good and accessible tool to show the sustainability and shortcomings of the PAs for growers, the public and policy actors.

__label__subjective World No Tobacco Day this year over advertisers Smoking kills six million people worldwide every year, and in Slovenia it takes 3,600 lives annually. On World No Tobacco Day, there are warnings about the dangers of smoking, including second-hand smoke. The horrifying statistics that six million people die every year from smoking worldwide, 600 000 from passive smoking, and 3 600 lives are lost annually in Slovenia, 900 of them under the age of 60, speak for themselves. If we do not change our tobacco use patterns, as many as one billion people will die from tobacco in the world in the 21st century. <p/> Worldwide, 1.3 billion people smoke. If smoking were reduced by between 20 and 25 per cent, as many as 100 million premature deaths would be prevented by 2020. This makes it one of the most preventable deaths, but efforts are still lacking because the tobacco industry holds the reins. <p/> Stop the tobacco industry's marketing! The theme of this year's World No Tobacco Day, first proclaimed by the World Health Organization in 1987, is Stop Tobacco Marketing! Helena Koprivnikar from the Institute for Health Protection of the Republic of Slovenia warns that marketing is one of the most important causes of the spread of tobacco use and that urgent action is needed to prevent and reduce the prevalence of smoking among adolescents and young adults and to complement measures to reduce smoking among adults. In the European Union, 70% of smokers start smoking before the age of 18. <p/> According to the Institute for Health Protection, 24% of the population aged 15-64 in Slovenia smokes, more men (27%) than women (21%). The proportion of male smokers has been increasing in recent years, mainly at the expense of the proportion of female smokers. The proportion of adolescents and young adults who smoke is largely stable, but the proportion of adolescent women who smoke has increased. Among adolescents aged 11-15, just over 29% have tried smoking, more boys than girls. <p/> New Tobacco Directive with tougher restrictions The European Union is currently negotiating a proposal for a new Tobacco Directive that would completely ban the advertising, promotion and sponsorship of tobacco products. This includes the introduction of large composite warnings, which would include colour photographs in addition to text and would cover 75% of the front and back of cigarette packs and rolling tobacco. It also provides for a ban on the sale of tobacco products with distinctive flavourings and additives that give the impression that the tobacco product is less harmful to health. <p/> European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Tonio Borg, urged Members of the European Parliament and European Health Ministers to support the proposal for a new Tobacco Products Directive and stressed the importance of efforts to reduce the attractiveness of smoking and tobacco products to young people. <p/> Free smoking cessation programmes in Slovenia Nataša Blažko from the Ministry of Health said that Slovenia is a strong supporter of the new directive as tobacco is a major burden in Slovenia, explaining that the proposal brings changes in a number of areas, but also adds new areas, such as the treatment of electronic and herbal cigarettes. The Ministry of Health financially supports various programmes aimed at preventing young people from starting to smoke and at smoking cessation in all population groups. Slovenia is one of the few countries where primary health care provides free smoking cessation programmes. B. T.

__label__subjective Janša against the referendum <p/> 3 June, 2012 - 20:00 <p/> Text. <p/> Are the parties sincerely ready to "unite" for a radical limitation of the referendum? Prime Minister and SDS leader Janez Janša has surprised - and it seems that this will not be the first time - his colleagues and the political public. In order to complete his mandate and push through several difficult reforms, he is ready to compromise in any way that would limit the referendum. Even to stand his own positions on their head. <p/> For more careful political observers, however, this should not be too surprising. The government, as we can observe every day, insists on (social) dialogue whenever it is threatened with a blockade. The principled positions and definitions that the SDS has been dragging behind it for years are pushed aside. Only results matter, even before the EU institutions. <p/> One can imagine Janez Janša and his predecessor Borut Pahor in Brussels explaining the peculiarities of our state system and the possibility of a referendum to put the foot down on a hardly expected law or agreement. A pension or arbitration agreement, for example. They are probably not very interested in such explanations. As I said, it is only the results that matter. Unlike Janša, Pahor has been much less flexible. The story of why he did not give the unions one more step last year and prevent the pension reform from failing is not yet entirely clear. But the responsibility is clearly his.

__label__objective Black tea and preparation: <p/> Black tea is the "mainstream" tea in terms of world consumption, although it is still a newcomer in the history of time, so to speak. <p/> Picked Camellia sinensis tea leaves are left to wither for a while. This is followed by a rolling process, either by machine or by hand, which extracts the juice with enzymes. The following fermentation phase is the most delicate part of the black tea production process. It is carried out at a temperature of 27 degrees, with the addition of moisture, and the essential oils are extracted. During this process, the leaves are coloured black, and finally the tea leaves are dried with hot air and separated by size through sieves. <p/> In general, black tea has a stronger flavour and contains more caffeine than less oxidised tea (green, oolong or white). Unlike other teas, it retains its flavour for several years and, despite oxidation during processing, acts as an antioxidant. <p/> Flavouring tea became popular in the 19th century.The most famous flavoured black tea is undoubtedly Earl Grey with bergamot oil, but other flavourings are also used (vanilla, coconut, almond, mint, etc.).

__label__subjective 27.09.2006 I find the title question interesting. Sometimes it seems to me that most people do not even ask it, because we live in a more or less school-taught and almost taken-for-granted belief that we judge things, people, their actions and events on the basis of the facts and by using our own common sense. And, accordingly, many people would probably answer the question posed by the title by saying that it is the authority of the argument that applies to them, not the other way round. But is this true? And how about in law? Are we persuaded by arguments or by the authority of the person who presents them? <p/> With the New Age and the tradition of the Enlightenment, the belief in human reason (ratio) became firmly established in Western society. This was particularly due to the development of the natural sciences, which, with their (apparent) exactitude, in many respects inspired legal thinkers. In particular, the proponents of the rationalist view of natural law, according to which the fundamental principles of law are somehow axiomatically rooted in ordinary human reason, believed that from the (highest) principles of law (e.g. neminem laedere or pacta sunt servanda) the correct solution to any legal problem or question could be found by deductive reasoning. This almost "mathematical" conception of law also led to the belief that legal reasoning is done by demonstration, i.e. by illustrative and formal logical demonstration or proof. However, after the more modern natural sciences have disproved the belief that science can be purely exact, and after the relativistic world-view (which is also known from many earlier historical periods, e.g. from the time of ancient Greek sophism) has regained a large measure of its right of homeland in the social sciences and law, faith or trust in the method of legal demonstration has in many respects also been dispelled. In its place, especially in the second half of the last century, the idea of legal argumentation came to dominate the field of legal logic. Although the term 'demonstration' is still used in many places in law and more widely today, it is in fact increasingly used to mean persuasion. Since, as I have written in various places, everything is relative in space and time, so is (i.e. relative) all (legal) evidence. A fact is prima facie evidence of guilt for one person, but not for another. If nothing else, a fact can be shown in a completely different light than it was previously shown in a narrower context, simply by expanding the (temporal, spatial, mental, emotional, etc.) context in which it is observed. <p/> All this is particularly familiar to lawyers. What is pure and indisputable truth to one litigant is pure and indisputable falsehood to the other litigant, the facts being the same but the human interpretations of those facts (and indeed of the legal norms) being different. Of course, sometimes a so-called material fact can be completely indisputable in itself (e.g. the identification of an object, DNA or blood traces) and as such really proves something. But one can expand the context and say that in the process of identifying such a fact (e.g. identification of the murder weapon, the perpetrator or DNA) there was a mistake, or even conscious manipulation, lying, etc. Therefore, any evidence is only valid as such to the extent that it is convincing to those who judge it. Convincingness, however, is to a large extent related to our subjective perception and evaluation of the world around us. In law and in life in general, we are therefore constantly persuading ourselves. If we come across someone with similar values, education, etc. to our own, we will quickly click with them and the need for persuasion will diminish. In the opposite case, i.e. when we encounter a person with a completely different way of thinking and value worldview, even with the most obvious facts and evidence (in our opinion, of course), we will not be able to convince (much less "prove") that we are right about something. If you don't believe me, just start talking to people about politics. Put forward a few of your own claims that you think are based on demonstrable facts, preferably relating to denationalisation, redress, assessment of the current or previous government, etc. I think you will quickly come across someone whom you will not be able to convince of your "facts" or "evidence". <p/> Anyone who has managed to follow my train of thought up to this point (which of course is not necessarily the case) can now easily see that (as Kant might have said) facts are not only something we perceive, but above all something we (co-)create. It is therefore important to be as convincing as possible in relation to others and to ourselves in defining or evaluating facts, that is to say, to be able to argue our views and positions as well as we can. But now let us ask ourselves what I said in the title of this paper. Is it the authority of the argument or the argument from authority that is decisive for us? Are we more persuaded by a good, skilful, illustrative, comprehensible, etc. argument, or are we more persuaded by the authority of the personality of the person who is making the argument? <p/> The answer to the above question is, of course, by no means unambiguous, because the two are intertwined. But nevertheless, if we look a little deeper into the matter, we can quickly see that in life in general we trust the argument from authority to a markedly overwhelming degree. Just think about how many things in life we know enough about to be able to make reliable judgements about statements of fact that are explained to us by someone who knows better. Can we judge for ourselves the arguments put to us by a doctor, perhaps even a surgeon, a physicist, an architect, a builder, an electrician, this or that legal specialist, a historian, etc.? Is it not the case that we simply believe most of these people, trust them? And if we don't, then we find someone who does. And if someone we trusted disappoints us, we look again for someone else we can trust - a new dentist, mechanic, plumber, carpenter, lawyer, politician, etc. <p/> All this makes us realise the crucial importance of trusting people, not arguments. Since this is also extremely important for law, I will devote a future column to reflecting on the importance of trust in law, drawing on some of the thoughts presented here. For the moment, let me just say that anyone who thinks that they are guided to a greater extent by the authority of argument in judging things and people and their actions and behaviour is probably mistaken, because in reality we humans are predominantly following the authority of personality. In law, as in ethics, politics, religion and even science, we are in fact usually more persuaded by who than by what (although the two are in fact interdependent). If, for example, we are watching a controversial panel discussion on a topic on which we are more or less unfamiliar (or at least not sufficiently familiar with the relevant facts), then the persuasiveness of the persons presenting the arguments will play a decisive role in our decision as to which arguments are more persuasive. This persuasiveness is a certain emanation, a personal magnetism that people perceive according to their own (subjective) mental, energetic, emotional and other qualities. Of course, we should not overlook that this is a matter of sympathy, which means that we can only ever be represented in authority by someone who is close to us in what they do or represent, i.e. sympathetic in the true sense of the word.
__label__subjective Nemo, an extremely powerful song, where the performance (at least for me) is a bit of a distraction. <p/> The poem doesn't rhyme, so why the marked word order in so many places? Perhaps for a touch of archaism? Well, your poem doesn't need you (in my opinion). <p/> It seems to me more a problem of rhythm. I'll try to do something about it, I'm still kind of hunting for a poem form like that - but thanks for the comment :) <p/> Yes, it seems to me that the rhythm doesn't go down, and it doesn't go up if you just normalise the word order. But the wording is already strong enough that you don't need embellishments (which the marked b.r. definitely is, and which I think comes into play (almost!) exclusively when chasing rhymes. <p/> This below is not some special "idea" that you are asking for, but quite simply - how I see (read) the poem: <p/> So, Lidija, I took your advice - and just corrected the order, because if I were to fumble again it would just be even more archaic and even more awkward than the first layout :) Thank you.

__label__objective The weather has not been kind to football activities lately, but the pitch has been cleared and we are back in Ljudski vrt on Saturday. "Since January we have had big problems in the training process because of the weather conditions. Back then we could have substituted some dates with a different training session, which we cannot do now, but we are well prepared regardless," says Darko Milanič, looking forward to the continuation of the season. <p/> And it is the next opponent that is among the most desirable. During Friday's match preview in front of the press microphones, the coach was asked if he could remember the last time we finished as losers against Velenje? "I hope I will be asked the same question before the next game against Rudar," he smiled and continued seriously: "Rudar confirmed their quality during our match in Velenje. They were really restrained as hosts in the first half, we had a lot of chances, but then they showed a different face, which we have also seen in other matches. This is a good warning for us ahead of Saturday's game, but as a whole we have more quality. Having said that, we have been without a game for a long time and we are already missing the competitiveness, so we are all together looking forward to another test where we want to start a new winning streak. We have worked hard to maximise our performance and behave as we did in the autumn in the domestic championship. " <p/> Alongside the injured Timothy Dodlek, the team will be without the " yellowed " Nusmir Fajic. " He was in great shooting form, unfortunately he will not be there this time, but we have also worked these two weeks to make sure that all players are effective. We have several foreigners at our disposal and I will decide who to give a chance. Ibraimi is also back tired, he has two national team games in a row and six club games before that, and we will see what condition he will be in on Saturday. "
__label__subjective Today, thinking or the free public use of the mind is once again becoming a matter of survival. Delirium is at the core of the political mainstream. This is also reflected in the sentence uttered by the Finance Minister-designate at Monday's hearing: "We find ourselves in an extremely challenging situation where, logically, we should be doing something, but we are forced to do the opposite." Mramor's sentence thus suggests that the incoming government will take decisions that will go against logic, i.e. common sense, and therefore against what would be best for the majority of people. <p/> So the government will continue to follow the delirious path that is deepening the crisis, imposing policies as solutions that have long since been proven to be counterproductive and harmful. Therefore, as long as we allow those who have received their mandate from the people, in their self-confidence and harmful optimism, to continue to take decisions unhindered, not by following the logic of things, but by following its opposite (where the guiding principle becomes the service of this or that private interest to the detriment of the community), a way out of the crisis is neither probable nor possible. <p/> Today's problem is not at all a lack of optimism or even pessimism, as one might think if one were to accept uncritically the statements that people in the highest positions make in the public arena. What is much more problematic at this time is a particular kind of optimism, which is most often expressed by the very representatives of the political and economic elites. <p/> We could get an impression of such optimism listening to the outgoing Prime Minister in an interview on the national television channel. In particular, she praised the past achievements of her government, and then went on to talk, with a kind of barbecue, about how she is convinced that, in the end, we will find a solution to the problem that will arise when the route of the pipeline is decided again, where the interests of Russia and the EU are in conflict (and she herself will have to do a somersault in her future role as Commissioner, representing exactly the opposite position on this issue to the one she held as Prime Minister when she met the Russian gas tycoon), which will definitely make the future bright. <p/> Her completely uncritical rant, which was also without a hint of feeling for the difficult situation in which many families and individuals in this country find themselves, having to deal with questions about how to get through the month on a daily basis, is not an isolated case, though. Optimism has become quite commonplace in the speeches of politicians, although it is difficult to show that it actually accompanies action to improve the quality of life of citizens - it often appears precisely in the absence of any substance, or when someone in a position of responsibility is rightly expected to make a constructive proposal or take a very concrete step (because that is what they are elected to do), and yet, by waxing lyrical, they are hiding the fact that they have no idea of how to tackle the most acute problems. <p/> One of the most optimistic politicians here is certainly the President of the country himself. In a recent speech, he said this: "If we are smart, brave and composed enough, we can now finally turn things around. Over time, people's living standards will rise again, our confidence in the country's legal and political institutions will be strengthened and an encouraging, optimistic mood will return." What exactly is the basis for such optimism? What - apart from fine words - is there here to inspire credibility? What political solutions to one of the most serious problems, such as the growing poverty among the population and the immense enrichment of a minority, are promised in the actions of the incoming government? What reason for optimism should we have in view of the fact that the unemployment rate has not changed significantly and that there is no prospect of any beneficial changes any time soon (and with the statements of the future Finance Minister, there are perhaps even fewer reasons for such optimism)? <p/> On the side of those in power today, the trend is one of optimism and overconfidence, which could more accurately be described as pathological narcissism, where the rest of us are reduced in their eyes to a passive audience that is merely there to validate their inflated egos (the various fights for the post of Commissioner and the self-aggrandisement of who is better suited for it are a sign of this very phenomenon). <p/> It may seem to some that, since we still do not have a prescription for how to build a democratic society, it is best to leave things to those who have already "screwed up" many things in the past (just think how many members of parliament and even of the incoming government have formed past "fallen" governments, and have now been given a mandate again for the next few years), since they are at least old acquaintances on the political scene (and should therefore know how to go about the management of common affairs). <p/> Some change of mind is needed. Derrida's idea of democracy implies that democracy is a process that is also a learning process: democracy is the happening, the practising or learning of democracy. So the (democratic) communion has yet to be invented or inventing. An honest attitude is therefore not the flimsy optimism of a Pahor or Bratušek, but anything but. It requires a lot of thinking, intellectual work and experimentation, trying out the ways in which people organise their daily lives in community. And that means that it will only be possible when people try to live it, to put it into practice, to practise it, and therefore when they come to the debate without asking the authorities for permission. Democracy cannot be taught to the people, nor is it necessary. But a certain amount of self-reliance is certainly in order. It is probably true that any political engagement requires a great deal of thought, study and insight into many complex issues, but that does not mean that one should remain silent until someone gives the floor and allows one to speak up. Democracy cannot be some once-and-for-all status quo brought to the people by a good man like Santa Claus. This is why Derrida stressed that democracy is always its own promise, something that is always yet to come (if people work for it, of course). <p/>The biggest obstacle to democratisation and engagement is not ignorance at all, because Socrates already knew that it is in fact the privileged place of the production of all possible knowledge. The greatest obstacle to both the spiritual or mental progress of the individual and the progress of the community towards the common good is the arrogance that is everywhere today in the words of the most influential politicians and other members of the elite. Listening to politicians of the highest rank, from the President of the European Commission to prime ministers and economists of the international financial institutions, one gets the impression that they all know the solutions, we just have to let them implement them. (And then, when these people are actually given a free hand, more often than not, the opposite happens: problems are potentiated, because their "solutions" become the real problems - just remember t. (This is because such arrogance is akin to stupidity, which invariably has very concrete (and most often disastrous) effects on the people who are forced to live under its rule. This is also why it is necessary to shake off the prejudice that the ruling class always knows what it is doing. (All we can do, then, is to leave it alone in its self-delusion and join in the optimism it calls us to). This prejudice is also supported by the view that, in the circumstances, it is best to keep to oneself and mind one's own business, which then leaves the people on the political periphery as a more or less helpless bystander. <p/> The process of democracy therefore necessarily coincides with resistance to whatever makes it impossible (today, this is especially capitalism and its sadistic imperative to increase and centralise profits). Resistance is therefore logical, rational, in the name of logic. But without a critical attitude and a systematic use of doubt (especially when we are confronted with the statements and actions of agents of power), we cannot speak of democracy at all. <p/> Much more than simulated optimism, what we need is resistance in the name of logic, i.e. of mental action: this coincides here with an unshakable trust in the power of intelligence, i.e. in man's creative capacity and power to produce new ideas (such a trust has been contemplated by Enlightenment philosophers from Socrates and Plato to Spinoza and Descartes and Kant and Derrida...), which will, as an important part of the process of democracy, determine the shape of the world to come.

__label__subjective 12.5.2014 <p/> The healing properties of yoghurt <p/> Yoghurt is very healthy as it is full of calcium and protein, and is easier for our bodies to digest than milk. <p/> 1. Yoghurt is an excellent source of calcium and protein. Calcium is needed for healthy bones, so yoghurt should be consumed especially by the young and the elderly. In addition, yoghurt contains twice as much protein as milk, which our bodies need to function properly. <p/> 2. If our digestive system is healthy, it will absorb all the vitamins, minerals and other substances it needs from food. But for the digestive system to function properly, we also need food to keep it healthy. Yoghurt is one of the foods that has the most positive effect on our digestion, so make sure you include it regularly in your diet. <p/> 3. Yoghurt also boosts the immune system as it contains cultures of living organisms. These boost our body's defences, so when we are stressed or it is cold outside, we should eat yoghurt to protect our bodies against illness. <p/> 4. Some people find milk very difficult to digest because of the lactose. Yoghurt contains much less of it and scientists have shown that this makes it easier to digest. So anyone with digestive problems should eat at least one plain yoghurt a day.

__label__objective In mid-August, we will experience one of the most famous meteor showers. Most of them will be seen on the night of 12-13 August 2017. We can expect 40 to 50 meteors per hour, which is less than usual as the Moon will interfere with the observations. <p/> Meteors from a single swarm seem to come from the same point in the sky. Source. <p/> Meteors are visible because tiny dust particles glow as they travel through the Earth's atmosphere at high speed. The average speed at which particles fly through the air is about 59 km/s. At that speed, it would take one second to travel from Ljubljana to Koper, and less than five seconds to travel across Slovenia. <p/> The fear of a meteor puncturing your roof is completely unnecessary, as these particles are so fragile that they burn up high in the atmosphere (over 90 km up). The Perseids are known for their many bright meteors (bolide), and the average Perseid is as bright as the brightest stars in the sky. The brightest bolide can leave trails that remain visible to the naked eye for several minutes in a dark sky. <p/> Comet Swift-Tuttle. Source. <p/> The source of the particles that cause the meteor shower comes from Comet Swift Tuttle, which is still orbiting the Sun today. It is 27 km across and, if placed on Earth, would be about the distance between Ljubljana and Logatec. The orbits of the comet and the Earth are 135,000km apart at their closest point (ten times the diameter of the Earth), making the comet potentially dangerous in principle for a collision with Earth. The comet was observed in China as early as 69 BC and scientists calculate that it will reappear in 2126. The Perseids, also known as the Tears of St Lawrence, were discovered by Belgian Adolphe Quetelet. In 1835, he published that meteors, which are common in August, come from the constellation Perseus. <p/> When to observe?

__label__subjective Demand for timber construction is still generally quite modest for the most part, so it makes sense for countries to encourage it through various measures. <p/> Finland's wood building promotion programme is already showing results <p/> The use of wood in construction has become more popular again in recent years, with some countries promoting it through specific measures. This is also the case in Finland, where a seven-year wood building promotion programme is already showing results. According to Petri Heino, administrator of the programme, key measures include changes in legislation and financial incentives. <p/> Demand for timber construction is still generally quite modest, so it makes sense for countries to promote it through various measures, said Petri Heino of the Finnish Ministry of the Environment. "Governments can provide, among other things, changes in legislation, financial incentives and the dissemination of good practice examples to promote sustainable construction," he said. <p/> In Finland, he said, it is by combining these three measures that progress has been made. "We have been able to involve a wide range of stakeholders in promotional activities," he said, recalling the size and indirect positive effects of the construction sector. <p/> Finns have had subsidies for the construction of wooden houses for several years, and since the beginning of this year the government has increased them further. The amount varies depending on the region; for example, in the Helsinki metropolitan area, the subsidy is €15,000. <p/> In Finland, a specific programme is being implemented under the auspices of the Ministry of the Environment to promote timber construction in the period 2016-2022, which aims, among other things, to foster the growth of an internationally competitive timber construction industry, both in terms of know-how and domestic production, and to support the sustainable use of forest resources. <p/>The programme's objectives include a ten per cent annual growth in the construction of wooden residential buildings, as well as an increase in the carbon sequestration potential of wood products, the share of wood in public buildings and the export of wood products. "The mid-term review of the results, carried out in 2018, showed that the activities have had a positive impact in most of the target areas," Heino pointed out. <p/> The use of wood in construction is commonplace in Finland, he said, as they have extensive forests that are producing more annual growth than ever before. It is currently at around 110 million cubic metres, of which between 65 and 70 per cent is felled. <p/> Young Finns are also aware of the importance of wood. According to Hein, a recent study showed that 69 per cent of girls between the ages of 14 and 23 support the idea of increasing wood use. <p/> Slovenia is also working to further promote wood as a renewable resource and an opportunity to enhance the added value of products. Among other things, the country aims to achieve a 30% share of wood in public buildings and to increase domestic log processing to three million cubic metres per year. <p/> Heino said that while the starting points are encouraging, it will be useful to further address these issues in the future through changes in legislation, educational content and various policies. <There are also opportunities for cooperation between the two countries. "There is already informal cooperation at ministerial level, and we are also cooperating in the research field, where there are opportunities to build on," he added.

__label__subjective First documentary by Natalia Gros <p/> New Partisan Cinema in cooperation with Film Servis presents a new documentary on sport climbing, directed by Jureto Breceljnik, entitled Chalk & Chocolate. The film tells the story of Natalia Gros, one of the best climbers in the world, who takes on one of the most difficult routes in the country: Histerija (8c) in Mišja Peča. About a year ago, she became the fourth woman in the world to climb this difficult route. The camera follows Natalia's story both during the conquest of Histeria and during the competition season (training, competitions, injuries, testing). The filming started in December 2007, when Natalia first set out on the route, and the crew was with her from day one until the day she climbed the route. It shows both the tears and the joy, with the background of what it takes to achieve your dreams. Natalija started her climbing career at the age of 7 and has been one of the world's top climbers for many years. In 2007, she achieved the European title of her career, and became the most successful female sport climber of the season. Now that she has made her first film, she is thinking of swapping the climbing world for Hollywood when her career is over! <p/> The film has already been previewed at the 3rd International Mountaineering Film Festival 2009 at Cankarjev dom, where it received great applause and two awards.

__label__objective The Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre of the Franciscans of Kamnik, located in a corridor next to the presbytery of the monastery church, is a unique piece of Plečnik's art, full of symbolism. The plans for it were drawn up in 1952 and it was completed in 1954. More... <p/> The monastery chapel was used as a prayer room and for the installation of the Nativity scene and the Holy Sepulchre. The architect was assisted by the local pater Martin Perc. Previously, Plečnik had rebuilt the church in Stranja and planned the baptistery in Nevlje on the orders of Father Perc. Plečnik stripped the plaster from the stonework in the chapel and emphasised the intermediate joints. The stone wall is connected to the lower edge of the plastered surface by a corrugation, which has the function of a seam. On the altar table stands a monolithic tabernacle made of underbaked brick, with stone and brass candlesticks on either side of the tabernacle. Behind the tabernacle is a luminous circular screen. The ceiling is a timber structure made of logs, supported on timber lintels on timber cantilevers. Three chandeliers are fixed on each side of the sloping beams under the logs. This is the theme of the tent, which Plečnik took from the famous mid-19th century German architect and theorist Semper. The walls and ceiling are executed in the architect's characteristic late-period sgraffito technique. Inscriptions, symbols of Christ's martyrdom and geometric borders are included. The window looking into the church has a pair of double polished dark marble mullions on each side. Opposite the altar, a figure of the Crucified is mounted on an alabaster slab in a T-shaped frame. The handle on the door is in the form of a stylised dove. The chapel's furnishings contain a great deal of symbolism. Small metal lights, which some believe resemble military helmets, are arranged around the ceiling. They radiate a short beam of light upwards, giving the appearance of a starry sky. The beams on the ceiling of the altar part suggest the stable or manger of Christ, while the monolithic tabernacle symbolises the rock tomb of Christ. Thus, the cycle of Christ's birth, death and resurrection is symbolically completed. <p/> Dr. Andreja Eržen, historian, Director of the Agency for the Development of Tourism and Entrepreneurship in the Municipality of Kamnik, spoke on camera about the furnishings of the monastery chapel.

__label__objective Merkel would agree to minimum wage <p/> Berlin, 21 November (STA) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel today signalled that Germany is on the verge of introducing a minimum wage. Ahead of a crucial negotiating phase in the coalition talks, she stressed that she was ready to compromise and estimated that the Social Democrats (SPD) would not sign the coalition agreement if it did not contain a deal on the introduction of a minimum wage. <p/> According to Merkel, "a grand coalition is not a politician's heart's desire". But the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and the SPD must respect the will of the electorate, she said. <p/> "The Social Democrats will not conclude negotiations without a legally defined universal minimum wage," Merkel said, according to the French news agency AFP. Her CDU, however, opposed such a move and the Chancellor insists that she and her party " will try to do everything to prevent job losses " as a result of this measure. <p/> The CDU believes that the minimum wage should be non-binding and limited to specific industries or regions, while the SPD insists on the introduction of a universal minimum wage of €8.5 per hour. <p/> Otherwise, the issues of dual citizenship and homosexual rights remain among the more contentious sticking points in the negotiations. Merkel insists that a deal is possible. "We will see in the next few days if we succeed. "According to the Chancellor, the coalition treaty should stand next Wednesday. <p/> According to the negotiators, there are still more than 100 policy areas open. It has even gone so far that CDU representatives have started mentioning new early elections. <p/> Today, after several meetings in small working groups, the negotiators of the three parties will meet for a seventh round of talks in a large group. They will discuss financial and health policy. They are also expected to touch on integration, with a deal on dual citizenship unlikely to be reached today. <p/> If the negotiations with the SPD are successful, Germany will be led by a grand coalition for the third time since the Second World War. In 2005, negotiations on the formation of a coalition government lasted 65 days. <p/> But even if the negotiations are successful, there is one more hurdle to overcome. According to the SPD's statutes, it is up to all of the party's 470,000 or so members, many of whom are not in favour of a coalition with Merkel, to decide whether to join a coalition. In 2009, after four years in Chancellor Merkel's government, the Social Democrats had their worst ever election result.

Kamnik is the cultural, administrative and economic centre of the municipality of the same name. As a result, several types of industries have developed in the area, ranging from furniture and metalworking to chemical and electrical engineering. Kamnik is located close to Ljubljana, just 25 km from the city, which means that it takes less than half an hour to get there. The town is also known as a town with a soul, as it is home to a wealth of cultural and natural attractions. This tells us that Kamnik is definitely one of the cities to visit, because there is so much to see. <p/> The town is also famous for its events, which are known all over Slovenia, and one of them is certainly the Days of National Costumes, which include dancing, music and more. A good choice, it is also a destination for all lovers of sport and recreation, as the forests offer plenty of fresh air and peace, which is why Kamnik has been attracting a large number of tourists lately. Here, they visit places such as Velika planina, which offers a wide range of sports activities and is one of the most famous hiking points in the country. You can also take a tour of the old town centre, which has many beautiful features and characteristics, including a Romanesque chapel and the Franciscan monastery. For a relaxing break, the Terme Snovik is the right choice, with a top-quality wellness centre and apartments that will delight you.

Proof that fashion and music are friends that go hand in hand and complement each other. The key concept of Jessica's femininity is fatality. <p/> The show started with a fashion video hinting at the upcoming collection. Maja Fučak and Nataša Janežič Žagar are the faces of Jessica's collection. <p/> During the process, she looked inward and asked herself what she wanted and what she didn't want. What is her world view and what does she want to offer to the consumers of her style. <p/> She started with the romantic Rococo period, which she interpreted into modern times. So, Rococo in the 21st century. She linked the historical period with Futurism, and the cuts themselves swear by constructivist principles. The colour palette features shades of greys, as well as electric blues and shimmering greys. The silhouettes are tailored to the female body, emphasising it, telling a story about it, not disfiguring it. Sharp symmetrical jackets and off-the-shoulder dresses, on the other hand, are replaced by light, asymmetrical dresses with white and blue floral prints. <p/> The richness and variety of the different garments allow for constant mixing and matching. <p/> During the design itself, we see a game of revealing and concealing and the woman who will wear it allows herself some clothing experimentation and has a clear vision of herself. The collection moves from spring to summer styling.

__label__objective Health Minister Aleš Šabeder sworn in before the National Assembly today, now he will have to speed up the rehabilitation of the health care system, starting with family medicine <p/> By Diana Zajec <p/> Article <p/> Ljubljana, 27 March 2019 <p/> Reading time: 6 min <p/> "Our current workload is beyond the limits of what is bearable. Despite the difficult situation, we are persevering for the time being, mainly because of the understanding of the management, which is doing its best to find solutions, including by recruiting additional staff, which is not approved and financially covered by the Health Insurance Fund," wrote 14 family medicine doctors from the Grosuplje Health Centre in a letter addressed to the ministry today. They did so in the hope that the newly appointed Minister of Health, Aleš Šabeder, will realise that placing the burden on the already pressure-ridden shoulders of family doctors is not a solution. <p/> The doctors from the Grosuplje health centre informed the new Minister of Health, Ales Šabeder, of their decision (to strictly comply with the professional collective agreement and the standards and norms set out therein, and to refuse patients if this would exceed the 1895 head coefficients), the reasons for their decision (to improve working conditions so that they can provide professionally appropriate care to patients) and any further action - including dismissal - if they are subject to any pressure, threats, mobbing or punishment as a result of their decision. <p/> The workload in the outpatient clinics far exceeds the professional standards and norms that are a prerequisite for quality and safe patient care, and all doctors are involved in 24-hour emergency care (both on and off duty), as well as in the post-mortem examination service. <p/> Grosuplje Health Centre doctors will now strictly comply with the professional collective agreement and the standards and norms set out therein - and will refuse new patients if this would exceed the 1895 headache coefficients. <p/> They are convinced that this is the only way to improve working conditions and, as a result, provide patients with professionally appropriate care. <p/> "In any case, in this situation we cannot and will not take on the additional burden of new registrations as provided for in the new General Agreement, and we have therefore decided to make this public in the attached statement. The statement has been shared with the representatives of the Institution's Council, who have unanimously supported us in this", wrote Sonja Gruden, a specialist in family medicine, on behalf of the 14 doctors who will give priority to professionalism and ethics. <p/> The decision of the doctors working in the Grosuplje health centre is not an isolated one; similar reactions and announcements have been made in Kranj, Celje, Nazarje, Ajdovščina ... and will be accelerated elsewhere in Slovenia in the future.

__label__subjective Spartacus, 4 June 2000, 0.10 <p/> original <p/> Cilician pirates <p/> translation <p/> Silesian pirates <p/> explanation <p/> The Silesians could have been miners at best. Silesia is a region on the border between Bohemia and Poland, far from any sea, famous, among other things, for its many mines. Spartacus, however, was betrayed by the Cilician pirates. Cilicia was an ancient province in the south of Anatolia, on the Mediterranean Sea. And a brief comment, lest anyone say that I am only criticising. The translator was obviously translating from a phonetic notation and she obviously understood the Silesian. Which is, on the one hand, perfectly excusable, but it is much less excusable that she did not find these Silesian pirates a little suspicious. It would have been enough for her to type Spartacus pirates into a search engine and she would have immediately found out that they were pirates from Cilicia, and then she would have typed Cilicia into the same search engine and found out where it was. All in all, about 10 minutes of work and one less mistake. (Nikolai)
__label__objective Description: Urban areas are characterised by high environmental pressures due to high population and economic development. In the past, these were the result of industrial plants and individual combustion plants, but now they are largely the result of increasing road traffic. A good understanding of the air pollution situation caused by traffic in the city is a prerequisite for designing effective environmental protection programmes and planning measures to reduce excessive concentrations of pollutants in the air. Emissions of pollutants from road traffic are difficult to measure and are therefore calculated on the basis of traffic data and vehicle category-specific emission factors. The methodologies used to control emissions from traffic differ in terms of input data, emission factors and the way emissions are calculated. Using the COPERT IV methodology, which is prescribed for national emissions reporting by the European Environment Agency but is less suitable for municipal reporting due to the difficulty of obtaining input data and the complexity of its application, we have determined emissions for the cities of Maribor and Celje. Based on the results of the COPERT methodology and data from the literature, we have developed a simplified methodology that requires less input data, is simple to use and at the same time efficient. Comparison of the results of the simplified methodology with the calculations of the COPERT IV methodology showed that the simplified methodology is suitable for estimating the total emissions of CO, NOx and PM10 pollutants from road traffic for the whole city of Maribor and smaller urban areas, and it is also suitable for estimating the CO, NOx and PM10 emissions from road traffic by vehicle category for urban areas with a number of registered vehicles above 20,000 and for estimating the total CO, NOx and PM10 emissions from road traffic for smaller Slovenian cities. Due to the expected changes in the structure of vehicles in cities, the simplified methodology should be reviewed and upgraded every three years Found in: keywords Summary of found:...

__label__subjective Television colloborations <p/> About a year and a half ago, Slovenia switched from analogue to digital TV reception. Quite a lot of people started to wonder what this would bring us and what it meant for our continued viewing of TV channels. The answer was very simple, because it was all due to the switchover to a newer technology, which, while it brings considerable improvements in terms of the picture and sound itself, before the switchover it was, in principle, more of a problem for the majority of the population. This difficulty meant either buying a converter or a new television that supports DVB-T. On this account, 2010 was quite a successful year for the sellers of this type of equipment, because monitoring programmes via an analogue signal was no longer possible afterwards, but I also think that both the Internet subs and the providers of other types of monitoring of TV channels were satisfied, because certainly not a few people opted for such a changeover. Eventually, the situation calmed down and it stopped being talked about, because things stood as they should. Well, yes, until it got complicated and a bit more serious. <p/> Earlier this year, Norkring ceased operating multiplex B (which they won the tender for), which contained TV3 and Pink Si, and the main purpose of the multiplex itself is to broadcast commercial programmes. Nevertheless, there were a number of other programmes that were licensed to be broadcast, but we did not see them during Norkring's management of multiplex B. Multiplex A, which is operated by Radio Television Slovenia, currently also broadcasts commercial programmes, even though it is intended only for national programmes. Thus, Slovenia has only one functioning multiplex, which contains both national and commercial programmes, and space for additional ones is running out. Since June, TV Slovenia's channels 1 and 2 have also been available in high definition (HD), but they can only be viewed by IPTV and cable TV users, and the switch to digital transmission has lost its significance, as HD viewing is not possible for viewers who watch the programmes via antennas. Instead, there are now four commercial channels in multiplex A, three of which - POP TV, Kanal A and Vaš kanal - have been there since the beginning, and were joined by Pink Si after the departure of Norkring. The multiplexes are now what they are, because the commercial channels will be in multiplex A until someone starts operating multiplex B again. This could be done again by Norkring or later after a public tender by someone else (source). <p/> On the other hand, there has been talk for some time of a new commercial programme, Planet TV, to be launched by Telekom, which would be quite different from the existing ones. Its content will consist of sports, films, serials and other programmes, and finally a news programme. It would be available via cable and IP television, and also via aerial reception (source). This is where the problem arises, because there are almost no more places in multiplex A, and the call for new channels was already published at the end of last October, with Golica TV, Sponka TV and TV Nakupi meeting the conditions. As the deadline (which is not legally binding) for issuing decisions is tomorrow, this could be delayed further, mainly due to pressure from Telekom, which did not apply for the tender within the October deadline (source). <p/> My view on all this is that, despite the pressure from Telekom, decisions should be issued to the programmes that applied for the tender in October and meet the conditions, and that once multiplex B has been given an administrator, the commercial programmes should go there and, if possible, TVS 1 and TVS 2 should start broadcasting in high definition in multiplex A. As for Planet TV, I hope that it will not be a copy of the current commercial programmes, whose main schedule is just commercials.

__label__objective Multimodal transport is the transport of goods all the way to the place where the goods will be handed over by the multimodal transport contractor. Here, two modern means of transport from two different transport industries are used simultaneously. Here, the first means of transport together with the cargo becomes the cargo for the second means of transport from the other transport sector, on the basis of one multimodal transport contract and one document, irrespective of the type and number of means of transport used. Therefore, in multimodal transport, the role of the customer of the multimodal transport is important. This branch of transport is complex, and a good multimodal transport contractor is therefore well placed to organise and execute multimodal transport at all levels. The multimodal transport contractor has an interest in performing contractual and non-contractual obligations as a good contractor, since it is liable from the moment of receipt of the goods until the moment of handover. It is also liable for the conduct of its servants and of other persons hired by it for the performance of the multimodal transport contract. It is therefore very important that the multimodal transport contractor adequately insures its liability, as it has no influence on the various risks it faces. The aim of this thesis is to explore in more detail multimodal transport, the multimodal transport contractor and its liability in multimodal transport.

Now that I see you're not as stubborn as lightning, please send me more bullets and David and I will give you an unbiased first hand assessment of the quality after a thorough examination... <p/> (16-01-2017, 21:11)apple Written by: I'd pretty much forgotten about those Arma bullets...but the early findings are this. The bullet has a harder core and consequently there is less copper coating, Los abandoned this some time ago and has the opposite...Tolerances, weight within normal limits, but on every bullet in the box, there is a matrix imprint at the transition of the radius to the tip, this is yet to be corrected, Los had the same problem and now it is solved, because such a bullet can not go abroad................................................................................. Nothing special in shooting, loading, of course for something more I would use rest, but for ipsc not even...as a type of bullet RN clean ok product. Price of bullets...wins the Moose, bold <p/> And this is the thorough test for you that you were raving about a page back? Ma dej... A 25,000 shus/year man is expected to have a concrete test, not to wash you. <p/> Mozakar has no time or else he won't reach the 25,000 norm this year <p/> Otherwise, a month and a half ago I found about 45 rounds of 147 grain in a package of 124 grain LOS 9mm kugels, FP. So even the LOS big-bore will probably have to learn, if nothing else, how to pack kugels. Price for mortals through official channels-> I don't know if LOS wins. 32€ vs 34€, at Rebec. <p/> Yeah well it says if you read it...conclusions at a glance I don't know what you expect, the point is said I have no intention of bothering with this really...why don't you give it a try yourself <p/> Great no...you'll have to learn a lot too, until then buy Arma bullets.... <p/> No I didn't buy them, if you're interested. I've bought quite a lot of LOS already, and I'm not going to stop because of this mistake. It just happens. You don't have to be a smartass like you to praise one, you probably get a ton of it for free. And especially in the Armaforce thread, when someone asked about those bullets, not the LOS. I get on LOS' nerves sometimes just because of your stupid crap. <p/> Just a quick comparison of one and the other was made, I gave my findings, but if you take that as bragging I can't help you, a hundred people are a hundred wonders <p/> Yeah well, it says here, if you read....you're the one bitching about a thorough test not me.So don't throw your fake tests at me. <p/> But you're not happy with the whole world, come on, be a little positive sometime, what is it man, what do you want to prove... I gave my findings, wrote that I had no intention of dealing with it and suggested that you find out for yourself if it's in your interest... my answer was not to your liking, you gave me a minus, you got it back... here's the way it goes in the new year <p/> The Master made the only sensible comment. The others are well below the level. I thought this was typical of jagras. But I see you are cutting us down. Armaforce made a big mistake by posting the LOS pictures. These are just marketing ploys of modern entrepreneurs. Any publicity is good, even if it is negative. It is naive to think that this was a mistake. If they know how to package the bullets (excellent packaging) then they should know how to present them to the shooters. This work was then done free of charge by Tine. You are asking for a detailed test from Apple. Why would the competition test their bullets at all? You are the top experts here on the pile. And yet you dispute Apple's brief quick findings. I am happy for any new manufacturer. But I buy the one that answers my questions. Price and quality. I have no dilemmas. Do you? <p/> Ah, I told you why ipsc is considered the king of marksmanship...because of the strict adherence to the rules and the immediate DQ at the slightest violation of them...the marksmanship of the individual has nothing to do with it, the shooters who take part in these competitions are all kings, as you rightly pointed out, thank you thank you...they know how to handle their weapons according to the accepted rules, because there is no other way to do it. I know that for someone who hasn't been to these competitions it's completely alien, how else to understand posting an unacceptable video where you have your finger on the trigger when loading and unloading the gun.... Ps the video is under...[adjustable sights for rexs] but it would be better if it wasn't... if you're still wondering what you're hoping for the kings will explain :))) <p/> Apple if you look very well the finger is not on the trigger.. So I don't see anything controversial..look well the finger was not on the trigger But I told you that you are the only "king" who is bullshitting about IPSC being oh and all.. If you were shooting a precision shooter this discipline would be the King of Shooting... As for Los...I see that whoever comes to the market with bullets you spit on them and bullshit them with nonsense comments....You could behave more appropriately for your age...You better be respectful to others on the market,because if David behaved like that the picture would be quite different...Sometimes you really throw shit on the forum and you mumble something but it would be better to bite your tongue...So think a little if your behaviour is "royal"...You'll have to think about that...<p/> (18-01-2017, 12:36)alojz1 Posted: I'm happy for any new manufacturer. But I buy the one that answers to me. Price and quality. I have no dilemmas. Do you have them? <p/> You're already happy, but Apple is not...So far he has spat on everyone and acts like he's the big i batina at Los... Unfortunately he can't stand that others are trying to launch their bullets on the market... When MiHec started making their bullets it was the same...Only Apple was throwing shit around the forum and acting smart about bullets...as if only Los knows how to make bullets and everyone else is a loser... Come on.... That's why Tine you will never make anything of yourself,because you don't know how to accept competition... You will always be just a man who knows how to screw people over very well,instead of giving some useful information for your years.. <p/> 18-01-2017, 15:06 (This post was last modified on 18-01-2017, 15:12 by alojz1.) <p/> Sandi, about the competition, just this. Everyone has their favourites. The thing with the Jags is that they are always looking for something new, something better. In short, a bullet that always hits without damaging the roast, and the game falls on the spot. And every new one is the best until it happens..... I also have good experience with both other manufacturers here. If anyone asks for an opinion I always praise them. In my opinion they are better than the much vaunted Barnes TTSX. I myself have been using LOS since the beginning. I recently killed an 80kg pig in the thick of it. Drop on the spot. Hit through the heart. Why would I buy an expensive one when this bullet has everything I need. You just have to hit it. But if I'm shooting at paper, it's hard to find a cheaper and more accurate one. And as long as that's the case, this bullet will be in my gun. You guys can keep switching all you want. <p/> I'm not picking on anyone :-P But if folks don't accept my thinking and can't argue back...that's not my problem. Me? prove it? I have nothing to prove. You are already proving yourself...day by day... Yes, you have made the points...but you haven't made the points...that you wrote about...that David and you are going to "debunk". In the end, all that comes out of your side is one big....bla....bla....bla....bla... ...blah. <p/>Ma what a clever comment, please. I don't think you can do it. Sessions can't stand anything but his own opinion....some of the sheeple cheerfully follow his lead. He can be a great shot,when he has a gewehr in his hands and has great results, but when he gives answers,he shoots goats....He usually speaks in terms of LOS is the law, or 25,000 shushes/year, IPSC, etc...etc...and that too many times when he has nothing to do with the topic. Let me know, did anyone force him to test? Well, no. Did he force himself to take the test? Well, he did. Someone who is supposed to have a clue about bowling pins, because he works in a bowling pin company, is expected to make a test according to his "tongue-twister", not to make a test like one of the yagers in the pub behind the bar would make it. <p/> 18-01-2017, 17:55 (This post was last modified 18-01-2017, 18:02 by alojz1.) <p/> Have you removed the Master's comment? I did mention it, 765Br quotes me now but I can't find it anymore. Did I misread something or are there strange things going on here? <p/> 18-01-2017, 18:12 (This post was last modified: 18-01-2017, 18:36 by apple.) <p/> Precision...will never be a royal discipline because doing things like yours seems to be common there and I started with precision I am no stranger to it...I still hope for every match unlike you who strictly reject ipsc but it would be to your advantage if I learned to behave SAFELY with a weapon. It won't stick...what you're doing in the video is pure DQ. The rule is that your finger must be visibly away from the trigger, it's not with you. It has to be VISIBLY extended at the bolt...with a hook like that you get an instant DQ on the ipsc...not to mention where the finger is after the gun is cocked...on the TRIGGER it could only be there when you are in the target sight The rest I don't care about...I don't have the ability to read people's minds, so I just don't comment on who's who... as for the Arma bullets, I wrote what I observed and I don't see anything else flying in there... <p/> (18-01-2017, 17:55)alojz1 Wrote: Did you retract the Master's comment?

__label__subjective Okič, Fani: Kingdom of the Great Serpent: on the culture of the indigenous peoples of pre-Columbian America from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego <p/> This book is one of a trilogy on the ancient history of precivilizations. The first is The Cracks of Time, the second is The Kingdom of the Great Serpent and the third is Megaliths. <p/>The author has devoted her life to researching proto-civilizations and changing (what she believes to be) mistaken historical truths. This book is no different. If the reader has any knowledge of historical facts, reading this book, and indeed all the others, will really put him or her in a dilemma. <p/>The Kingdom of the Great Serpent reads very smoothly, with a lot of historical facts, but they are explained in a different way than we have been taught. Official scholarship has not dealt much with her works, as it is very difficult to deny her claims, which are supported by many evidential sources. The book is about the indigenous peoples of pre-Columbian America. Her very first sentence: 'The Kingdom of the Great Serpent is not a book about Indians. ", shows very clearly the author's disagreement with official history. America was not discovered by Christopher Columbus, but there have been many civilisations on this continent since prehistoric times that are not given the status they deserve by official history. Many of the archaeological remains that have already been discovered testify to their remarkable knowledge of construction, which has been overlooked, and many more are still waiting to be discovered.
__label__subjective In every profession there are people who are more and those who are less friendly. But when dealing with customers, you should not be unfriendly, arrogant or even rude. Nurses come top in these qualities (in my experience). From the fact that one nurse, during the driving test, tried every means to convince me that I was anaemic - she did not even ask me if I was, which is what she said: ' You are anaemic, you are so anaemic. ' And she did not give up even after several assurances that I was not anaemic. Apparently it is difficult to understand that blond and blue-eyed people also tend to have less pigment in their skin. The height of rudeness is the nurse at my gynaecologist's (a woman who the whole medical establishment knows to be a tease), who gives you a hard time whether you do anything wrong or not. The desire to get a prescription for the pill on a day when they are working with normal clients and not with students is utopian with her. If you explain to her nicely that you are studying more than 100 km away and that you cannot come on a specific day, she tells you to go and see the man on duty on Saturday. That's logic for you. Also, as a student, I can only get an appointment over the phone on Monday (that's the day they have reserved for female students), not any other day of the week. Someone please explain this to me. <p/>The waiters have been in a bad mood for the last week. First I get several accusatory no's because I want to order food that is out of stock (how was I supposed to know it was out of stock! ? ! ), then my classmate and I are told to get our own Coke from the fridge. Serving at the table is obviously a utopia. Whereupon we are given glasses full of limescale, which they refuse to change because apparently they can't be washed any nicer. But I wash the glasses by hand and they are never full of limescale. Then, suddenly, a waiter thinks that rum tea is great if you make it with black tea. Well, it's not great, and I have used an extravagant amount of sugar to make it edible at all. How a waitress who cannot make either can work in a bar where there is a big sign outside saying mulled wine and hot chocolate, and who cannot make either remains an enigma to me. Especially since at least mulled wine is very easy to make ... <p/> Certain people think that customers need to understand that they are having a bad day. Unfortunately, I have never considered that to be the customer's task. If I myself am polite and friendly and don't complicate things (except in extreme situations), I expect kindness in return. Or at least the absence of unkindness. Not unnecessary complication, nagging and insults. Because I believe that these same run-of-the-mill nurses and waiters would not find it acceptable if one day they came to see me as a client (e.g. in my capacity as a psychotherapist or clinical psychologist) and I was rude to them because I was just having a bad day. No matter how difficult it may be, worries should be left at home, or at least not shaken at clients.

You should also be aware that you will only be moving your friends to the new profile (page), and all content that has been uploaded (photos, links, video, statuses) will be deleted. So before you do this, make sure you have a backup of your content (more here). <p/> Choose a category that is suitable for your activity. Be careful not to choose a community page if you don't know what you are doing (more here). If you would like to have a new page name, you should have done this earlier, on your private profile - because when migrating, Facebook insists that the page name is identical to the private profile. I chose to make my "test profile" a public figure, more specifically a celebrity. <p/> Once you've chosen the right category, get ready for the "magic". Your private profile will migrate to the page. And most importantly, all your friends have become your followers. So you haven't lost your base, Facebook has moved it to your page. Note that in my case it took about ten minutes for the situation to return to normal (first the page was unreachable, then it showed that there were no users). Well, now everything is in place ;) <p/> Now you have a page. You can add a new admin, or you can manage it with your old password and username, which only allows you to administer the page - you can't browse Facebook with it. The private profile has migrated to a "business account", which means that you need to create a new private profile if you want to continue to communicate privately on FB. <p/> More information about the private profile -> page migration can also be found on the Facebook help page. If you are a more casual user, I recommend that you do not do this process yourself ;)

__label__subjective 7. Fridays and Saints' Days <p/> First Friday and the Feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in June. Renewal of our consecration. Maybe for the first time, maybe for the tenth time? For the Diocese of Ljubljana, Bishop Gregory Rozman announced the celebration of nine First Fridays in 1941. Seventy years have now passed since then. That is a long lifetime, but some ninety-year-olds can still remember this inter-war event. The Bishop was concerned about the growing unbelief among the people and he explained the devotion of First Fridays as making reparation to the Heart of Jesus for all offences against God and also against the Church. That year, the war struck with only the first sweep, and the anti-religious spirit had been obviously and secretly at work for a long time. The Bishop called for repentance and respect for God's commandments. Is this call unnecessary today? Let us take a look at two families that call themselves Christian. After all, it does not even matter how many children they have. In the first, the day begins around six o'clock in the morning for the parent, and a little later for the schoolchild. They don't even see each other in the morning. The parents have a quick morning coffee, no time to even cross themselves and they are already on the carriageway. They all have lunch together later in the afternoon, and the aces don't even say goodbye. In the evening, the TV news is on and the schoolboy has a pile of homework for the next school day. It's fast approaching, and because the boy is independent - as he has to be - he takes the time to heat something up in the microwave, have a quick wash and throw his nice, friendly, "... good night, Mom. ' They go to Mass on Sundays several times and the boy doesn't feel bad at all at the service. But, he thinks, we don't pray much at home, even though Grandma often reminds us about it. They don't even have breakfast together in the second morning, but they pray first before lunch. They also pray together in the evening. On Sundays, they go to Mass in their own way, the parents are the readers of the readings, and the children are the singers and altar servers. The family resolution for the new calendar year is different each time, most often of a charitable nature. Neither the first nor the second family thinks particularly of the First Fridays, but neither of them allows anyone to dishonour any person or any religion. There are many families like this nowadays. If you put their religious life on a human scale, it would probably swing. Nor would a geometric measurement show the same line for the boundary of the spiritual. Let alone in families where there is hardly a whiff of faith left. What about those to whom faith is completely alien. What of those who are opposed to faith. The call to conversion is still needed. Perhaps ever more so. But it is necessary to know how to hear it. Yet, as loud and frequent as it is, it cannot touch ears that do not listen. The condition for a different way through the spiritual world is the willingness not to turn a deaf ear to Christian values and virtues. Faith is chief among them. Bl. It was very dear to Slomšek. He called it the light of faith, faith be your light. How precious light is, however, is best known in the darkness. Do we not find ourselves in darkness even when we cannot help ourselves in difficult circumstances? The smallest bit of faith can make it a little brighter. Trusting in God's mercy and help is that sliver of light. In the mystical vision of St. Faustina Kowalska, Jesus instructed her to pray much for the poor. She was a hidden pray for people she did not know. God would be caught in his own snare if he did not keep his promises. We have no influence on how and when they come true, other than our own perseverance in trust. All things work together for good to those who love God, says the Apostle Paul. Paul says in his Letter to the Romans (Rom 8:28), and adds. We must trust. On Fridays and holy days.
__label__subjective I suspect that there are at least a handful of us who remember all too well the days when Ray Cokes used to roll the Slayers unreservedly in prime time and when, in the admittedly slightly later hours of the night, MTV Europe used to play a lot of what we still throw into the drawer of alternative and not overly commercial brass bands and brass bands were listened to, not just watched. I wouldn't really debate the diversity of tastes here, but there was a lot to be heard on that channel in its day, especially if you were persisting in a late-night ambush or suffering from insomnia. It would be difficult to judge the current state of mind of all the various derivatives of this brass band institution; I have not been following it for some time, but judging by the words of my younger colleagues, the spirit of the eighties and early nineties has got a bit stuck and has gone on holiday somewhere unknown. <p/> Why such a butch introduction, anyway? Simply because Arrested Development is one of those bands that, without MTV and its inventions like Unplugged, would almost certainly not be known here. This predominantly black collective came to our country in the first half of the nineties on the waves of the aforementioned TV channel with their debut album, etched themselves in our little brains for eternity and then somehow disappeared from our consciousness, so the announcement of CUK in Šiška came as quite a surprise to me. I have to admit, I was almost convinced that AD had disbanded a long time ago, so I was quite happy to see them in Šiška, almost as happy as the fact that last year they released a quite decent and listenable album Strong, which, although it doesn't bring any particular surplus, is a quite pleasant read and the hiphop-funky-Motown inspired melodies easily crawl under your skin, which has been AD's virtue from the very beginning. All in all, a show that would be a sin to miss. <p/> If talking about the fact that the performers wowed the assembled crowd is usually as predictable as possible, I can say exactly that about Arrested Development's performance in Šiška. I haven't seen so many happy and satisfied people per square metre in a long time. Although Šiška wasn't bursting at the seams, it was exactly so full that one could comfortably move around, raise one's hands and sing a little here and there, although it was obvious that the majority of the crowd hadn't come any further than their debut album and, understandably, they were mostly tripping on those good old shtick that had gotten under our skin, or on the musical interludes of the legendary Bob Marley or the slightly less legendary 4 Non Blondes. AD are obviously well aware that their reach in Europe, where they have come after many years, was quite limited and that their brass band alone is just a bit too little to get people up on their feet, but on the other hand, it is a commendable act that the collective did not descend to the level of musical aspirations, although it was just not possible without the most famous shtick, especially in the finale. The intensity of the concert itself was at a high level from the very beginning and it got a bit higher towards the end, also thanks to the drum, bass and karaoke interludes, which, although they cheapened the overall impression a bit for my taste, then in a long encore, perhaps better said in the second part of the concert, they brought the show perfectly to the grand finale, when the brakes were released and the chemistry between the band and the audience worked so well that we can already speak of perfection. <p/> As they like to point out, AD play brass music for the people, by the people, and it would be really hard to find a better demonstration of this principle, especially if we're talking about big concerts, or concerts where at least a hundred or so heads are packed in and there's no question of an intimate atmosphere. There is no doubt that the ADs are well tuned and well tied and know exactly what and how to do to ensure that entertainment, mixed with a good-natured knock on the all-embracing human consciousness, achieves its aim and purpose. Truth be told, AD haven't come up with anything too revolutionary in the last fifteen years, but they make up for it perfectly with the sincerity they put into their music and, apparently, their performances, so it seems they are still that fresh band that exploded in our ears in the early nineties. There wasn't as much of a throwback in their performance as you might expect, more a kind of timelessness caught up in the here and now and a fascination with it, just as the band themselves seemed fascinated by the response they were getting. Look at the photographs and it might be clearer to you what I am trying to say. <p/> In short, the AD concert was simply an uninhibited, relaxed experience of an unpretentious brass band trying to please a wide audience, but not quite everybody and not exactly at any price, which is of course good for the audience, but a little less grateful for the performers themselves, who somehow remain in the shadow of the brass band, which in one way or another, not even necessarily a bad one, stands out and the whole. It's certainly fine and dandy to hear something new and unusual, but even simple entertainment, which nevertheless has a message and is not entirely shallow, is not superfluous and comes in handy now and then. AD are masters at this and it was a real pleasure to listen to them here for the first time, and I hope not for the last time.
__label__subjective On this JULY CULTURE DAY, or the birthday of Františ Prešeren, some of us poetry lovers gathered to meet the poet Robert Simoniškės, who was visiting our school as part of the Inviting the Word project, facilitated by the Slovene Writers' Association (Stowarzyszenie Slovenije pisateljev). In an hour and a half, Robert Simonišek showed us the other side of poetry, showed us what a poem can be, encouraged us to think about more challenging texts, to think about poetic freedom, the structure of poetry, to talk about Slovenian attitudes towards poetry and to say something about the somewhat bitter topic that we are reluctant to talk about, that sometimes Slovenian lessons have the opposite effect and discourage young people from poetry. Malgajev people are trying to change this by inviting real poets to speak, by daring to talk about pressing issues and by allowing the poetic language the freedom it has won in the world of art. We may host someone else next year, and we will certainly do some more literary workshops in poetry. And remember: POEMS ARE NOT IN THE WORLD FOR YOU TO TRY TO ANSWER " What was the poet trying to say? ", BUT TO MAKE YOUR LIFE BETTER. Bojana Potočnik
__label__subjective I would like to know a couple of things about cat acne, if anyone has any more experience. mainly I know about the so called black dots under the chin, which are supposed to be cat acne or fungus? I know it can be done elsewhere on the body. <p/> I have seen the occasional spot on the chin in one of our cats, but now I have a different problem. fergie has these spots just under her nose, just on one side, and on her nose, mostly on the same side. around her nostril, if you can imagine. let me say that she eats quite stump-eating, and a lot of the time her nose helps with things, so it seems to me that this could be the cause of this outbreak around the nostril.... <p/> yesterday I cleaned that area with splivasept and water and it all went away under the snout, the skin was red there, today it's better... it's healing. there's one part on the snout that remains. instead of having a nice coat there, she has a small scab that doesn't come off with washing. of course I don't think to rub it too much, because it's extremely uncomfortable for her if I do that. <p/> I wonder if anyone has any advice on how to proceed? of course I can take her to the vet, that's not a problem... but I understandably try to avoid it if I can, because I don't want to upset the cat if I don't really have to. <p/> In my opinion it's just dirt, and when it dries it can stick so firmly to the skin that it's yikes. I just find it odd that it's so noticeable, because Fergie isn't white around the snot. I suggest just tapping the spot several times in a row with a soaked cotton wool, waiting a little each time, and then gently removing. A one-off treatment will almost certainly not get it all off, so keep repeating it, but preferably not on the same day, so that you forget the maca a little in between. <p/> yes, it's black up there, yes, I looked at it so close I could see it when you put your finger over it, but you can still feel that little spot. <p/> I think it will go slowly, yes, at least it hasn't gone back to where it was before <p/> When I still had temporaries, I used to dab their acne (even in the spot you described, it was usually) with colloidal silver on a cotton wool a couple of times a day...then the scab came off, peeled off and everything was ok underneath. <p/> u yeah, I didn't think of it right away, but it's good stuff! i'll try to get it now <p/> but otherwise it's pretty good! one little thing is still on the top of the snot, the rest looks good. i was actually thinking that there's a chance that they scratched each other and that's what caused the scab and the acne... what do i know. <p/> now I have another problem, because she scratched her ear too fergie doesn't scratch very gently, if she gets scratched she usually scratches it clean to the fullest, so she slaughters herself if she has to <p/> she gets rid of them for a couple of months. And they do it again. And then we repeat the treatment again and it's ok, until next time. They don't bother him, they don't hurt, they don't spread. They always appear on his chin. We haven't had more than 4 months of peace from them since he was caught. He is a special little guy who needs a little more "maintenance", he is just worth it. I don't care either, because I know what it is, but it's nothing terrible. Just acne.
__label__objective Beatification of the Drin Martyrs in Sarajevo <p/> 28 September 2011 at 10:11 <p/> On Saturday, 24 September 2011, five Drin Martyrs, religious of the Daughters of Divine Love, were beatified in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the ceremony, presided over by Card. Angelo Amato, Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, was attended by some 18,000 faithful. The faithful from Slovenia also made the pilgrimage to the beatification in 13 buses. Among the five new martyrs are two Slovene women from Dolenjska, Sr M. Krizina Bojanc and Sr M. Antonija Fabjan. <p/> The journey of the Daughters of Divine Love from Pal via Romagna to Goražde took four days and four nights. They arrived in Goražde on the afternoon of 15 December 1941. They were placed on the second floor of the barracks. That same evening, wild and drunken Chetniks broke into their room and tried to kill them. In defence of their human dignity and their promise of chastity, the sisters broke free from the hands of their attackers and jumped out of the window one by one. Meanwhile, the Chetniks broke down in front of the barracks and executed the severely wounded sisters with knives. They were dragged to the river Drina, which carried their bodies away a few days later. S.M. Berchmana stayed in Sjetlina for ten days, where she recovered quite well. Then she was to go to Goražde, to the other sisters, who were already dead. Two Chetniks took her away on a sledge. When he returned, the coachman said that she had arrived safely at her sisters' home. The attendant, however, had a rosary around her neck. It is recorded that she was killed on 23 December 1941. Sisters Jula, Berchmana, Krizina, Antonija and Bernadeta, known as the "Drin Martyrs", served God generously and with selfless love, as missionaries in the "afflicted Bosnia", especially by helping the poor. They confirmed their fidelity to God by shedding their blood. <p/> Word of their martyrdom spread far and wide. Therefore, on 4 December 1999, Cardinal Vinko Puljić, Archbishop of Vrbas, after having obtained the necessary permission from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, issued a decree to begin the diocesan process for their beatification. The beatification of the Servants of God Sr. M. Jule Ivanišević and the four sisters is not only an official recognition of their martyrdom, but also a high recognition of the spiritual values for which the sisters lived and sacrificed their lives. Jula Ivanišević, Berchmana Leidenix, Krizina Bojanc, Antonija Fabjan and Bernadeta Banja are witnesses to an extraordinary fidelity to God and an active love for the poor. In faith, we rightly hope that their shed blood will be the seed of new Christians who are aware and responsible, and of new spiritual vocations for new times. Martyrs are strong intercessors in every need, especially in the difficult trials and dangers of life. Many have already seen this. <p/> Blessed Sr. Marija Krizina Bojanc, baptised Jozefa, a nun and martyr, was born on 14 May 1885 in Šmarjeta, Dolenjska. At the age of 36, she entered the religious community of the Daughters of Divine Love in Sarajevo. Full of sisterly love, she was distinguished for her constant prayer, sacrifice and penitential life. During her lifetime she was called "Sister of Prayer". She crowned her life in fidelity to Christ when, on 15 December 1941, she gave her life rather than renounce her vows and Christ. Her martyr's blood is clear proof that she loved God more than she loved her own life. <p/> Blessed Sr. Marija Antonija Fabjan, also baptised Joseph, a nun and a martyr, was born on 23 January 1907 in Mali Lipje in the parish of Žužemberk. At the age of 22, she entered the religious community of the Daughters of Divine Love in Sarajevo and made her vows on 19 March 1932. She was distinguished for her simplicity, sincerity, piety and self-control. Faithful to her religious vocation, she was tortured and killed on 15 December 1941, together with four other sisters. Out of love for Christ, she accepted martyrdom so that "the life of Jesus might be made manifest in her mortal body" (cf. 2 Cor 4:11). <p/> Both Slovenian sisters come from the diocese of Novomeč. <p/> The veneration of the Drin martyrs will take place on their death day, 15 December. <p/> The Martyrs are models of fidelity to God, of human and feminine dignity, of active love for their neighbours, and intercessors for new spiritual vocations, especially for women, as well as in the various trials of life.
__label__subjective Source of the survey, which is also at the bottom of this article. Author of the column. Thirty years ago, his parents might have had a problem with this innocent childish line. If there is a cult of personality and the state is a proletarian dictatorship - and in the SFRY it was almost a constitutional principle that the proletariat was in power - then children in schools must not make a fool of the supreme authority. <p/> Indeed, until the end of the 1980s and the Slovenian constitutional amendments, Article 133 of the Penal Code, which criminalised freedom of conscience and expression, was also in force. The verbal offence meant that one was not allowed to speak over the state, the system and the leaders. The statement "Comrade Tito has a fat arse" would have caused problems with the authorities in the SFRY. <p/> For many people who are strangers to Slovenia's obsession with socialism and Titoism, it is inconceivable how, in 2012, so many sensible people can be fascinated by the figure of one of the typical dictators of the 20th century. Because twenty years ago, nobody thought about Josip Broz.In the late 1980s, when democratisation was beginning, you would have laughed at someone idolising a marshal or even dressing in similar uniforms. <p/> In the late 1980s and early 1990s, it did not occur to people to deplore Yugoslavia, Titoism or self-management. There were too many challenges, and faith in the future was strong. Interestingly, there was no noteworthy event at Dražgoše in that period either. Third-class officials spoke, a few hundred people gathered. <p/> At the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, Titoism died out in Slovenia. <p/> Then something started to change at the beginning of the new millennium. Dražgoše suddenly took on a whole new glow and significance. They became a kind of value centre for an orthodox, pre-modern and quasi-partisan political rallying cry, aimed at mobilising the far-left electorate. In the light of historical facts, Dražgoše became Lažgoše. <p/> On a broader, social level, a reinterpretation of Titoism and history in Yugoslavia began to take place. Instead of historians shedding light on all the characters of the time - the only exception being Professor Jože Pirjevec's biography Tito and Comrades - and honestly saying that Slovenia had a semi-colonial attitude towards the southern fraternal republics (no, Slovenians will never admit that), an avalanche of amateurish interpretations of our heroic history took hold. <p/> Suddenly, we became the only nation to have preserved the tradition of Titoism. Only in Slovenia is the attitude towards Josip Broz markedly positive, and the memories of the SFRY bright and nostalgic. <p/> What is the reason for this, why is it so? <p/> Probably from our social pathology. Because other, much larger and more historic nations, which have the historical traumas of the 20th century, face similar problems in evaluating their psychopathic leaders - regardless of the degree of their autocracy. The Spanish, for example, with Franco. But Franco was at least as benevolent a dictator as our Tito. <p/>The Italians did not come clean with Mussolini. Partly because of a horribly incorrect education system which has not yet established the right degree of critical distance from the fascist period. <p/> The Russians are reviving the cult of the Georgian Stalin. They, too, have freaks dressing up in uniforms just like those worn by the Generalissimo with the moustache and going around, addressing people, appearing at obscure and less obscure events, pinching children's cheeks and saying that they are Stalin. <p/>Sick. But in societies that have not come clean about their traumas and fears, it happens. There is not such a big difference between Russia and Slovenia in this respect. <p/> The only reason Germans can't openly emulate Hitler (except right-wing extremists, whose political activities are largely banned) is because they have been sent through a process of denazification by their Western allies. The Austrians got away with it, hence Haider. <p/> There are more problems with the Slovenes. I have already written about this. The worse the present, the better the memories of the past. Since there can be no biological link with Titoism in the younger generations, institutionalised nostalgia for the old days is reinforced. This is no longer an innocent joke perpetrated by a certain Godnič. The revival of memories of the Day of Youth and the Titoist relay is a phenomenon per se. It is yet more proof of how lost, hopeless and pre-oedipal our 'liberal' and 'democratic' society is. <p/> So that there is no misunderstanding: the cult of Tito, of Franco or of Mussolini should be cultivated by people in peace in their own homes and, for my sake, in their cellars. In their private lives, they can do whatever they want. They cannot do it in public, or even within the framework of public institutions. <p/> Can you imagine if we had been lamenting Titoism in 1988 or 1992? Of course not. Only a few radicals did it then. Most Slovenians were happy to be out of the SFRY and out of the poverty of a failing country. <p/>Why, then, does it feel different today? Because of the economic and social situation? Certainly, the middle class is already or will soon be impoverished, more and more people are living on the poverty line, and in such a crisis situation it is understandable to recall times that most people no longer even remember, but are considered socially just (nobody went hungry, everybody was employed and similar wingnuts). But only in a society that is still a long way from maturity. Only in a country that is not aware of the foundations of its statehood. <p/> The idolatry of Titoism and the cult of personality is not irrational, as many people think. In my view, it all comes together in the context of Slovenian social pathology. We lived a relatively comfortable life materially and socially in the SFRY. The party elite in general. When the system collapsed because it was based on economically unsustainable assumptions, we decided to try capitalism. <p/> Capitalism has not worked very well in Slovenia. A friend of mine, who is a top workaholic and manager, says that the reason it has not is that the Slovenes have been 'Balkanised' by Yugoslavia and simply do not want to work any more. <p/> That is probably true to a certain extent. But the key problem of the hysteria about Tito and the Day of Youth can be identified very easily: as a country we have no identity, as a nation we have no will and no energy. <We really do not deserve a country of our own. And to paraphrase our beloved Titoists, Josip Broz would never have given it to us either. <Josip Broz symbolises socialist Yugoslavia after the Second World War: the reconstruction and construction of a war-torn country, socialist self-management, resistance to Stalin and the policy of non-alignment. It symbolises peace and full employment. On the other hand, it symbolises the cult of personality, the Naked Island, the beheading of liberals and the post-war killings. Under his leadership, Yugoslavia enjoyed great prestige in the world, and he will be remembered as an exceptional statesman. <p/> Špela Šipek, editor <p/> I think most people remember Tito as the figure of the commander who led the partisan army to victory over the fascist invaders and traitors. He symbolises the figure on the pedestal through which the PR machine promoted positive values such as comradeship, brotherhood, education, strengthening of mind and body. And, on the other hand, it symbolises the crime against those killed immediately after the end of the war and the persecuted political opponents. It thus symbolises the trauma of a part of the Slovene nation whose ancestors were killed or imprisoned, and of a part of the Slovene nation that is proud of its resistance against fascism. Although Josip Broz-Tito symbolises the past in its entirety, he also symbolises the division of the Slovenian nation, which is no less fervent now than it was twenty or sixty years ago. <p/> Janez Furman, parish priest <p/> Broz and Kardelj once came to the cross while walking along Brdo and looked up at Christ. Edi begins to explain how their lives were not always exemplary, yet they had come so far and this poor man had worked for the good of mankind and finally ended up on the cross. The marshal replies, "Eddie, when we die, they will have no nails. "And indeed, at the time of their deaths, you had a hard time coming up with nails. Before a critical historical distance can place Tito in the real context of his era, there will be spears being broken about his personality and his time in charge of the late SFRY. The abuse and the immature view of democracy have led many to associate the Marshal's figure as a mythical hero. Others who survived the Naked Island or any other repression would have erected a memorial to his sacrifice. Despite his glorification, we are all ordinary mortals together. <p/> Nina Ivanič, actress <p/> It is difficult for me to answer this question objectively, because as a primary school pupil I was constantly listening to and learning about Tito as someone who was all goodness, honesty, heart, ability and I could go on and on. In our childhood eyes, he was a great hero and a man with a big heart. That is what we were taught, that is what we believed. But there are two sides to every story, and so there are two sides to Tito's story. Over the years, many things have been revealed and all the glamour around Tito has slowly dissipated. In my adult eyes, he now symbolises something quite different from all of the above. Behind the pretty veneer, there is often an ugly and dirty side. <p/> Jure Apih, columnist <p/> There is not one Tito, there are many Tito's. He is the locksmith apprentice from Zagorje who learned to play the piano without any schooling, who won a medal in sabre fencing from the Austrian army and danced with the Queen of England on his island. He is a Bolshevik agent who mysteriously survived Stalin's purges. He is the leader and marshal of the only real resistance army in the Second World War. He is the war criminal responsible for the greatest indiscriminate slaughter of prisoners and civilians in Europe. He is the only leader who dared to stand up to Stalin and to lead his people on a third path between socialism and capitalism, between one-man rule and self-rule. He is the historic spiritual leader of a non-aligned world, of more than half of humanity, and his funeral brought together a crowd of world leaders like never before. He was a thistle and a "sweetheart white". Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo is the apprentice against him. <p/> Irena Prijovic, economist <p/> JBT symbolises the leader of Yugoslavia. What this symbol means to whom depends on the individual. It depends on which generation one belongs to, whether one is and how one lived at that time, whether one is a foreigner or someone who was once a Yugoslav. It depends on how history is summarised and interpreted. Personally, I associate Tito with a peaceful childhood, my own ignorance and the kind of illusion we were living at the time. <p/> I have just returned from Berlin and I am still under the impression of the symbols of the divisions of post-war Germany in that city. While the East Germans demolished the wall for a long time in various ways, and once it physically fell, we ourselves paid the highest possible price by fighting a war on the premises of the former state. <p/> Dr. Samo Rugelj, columnist <p/> It depends for whom. For some of the older generation, Tito is often still a symbol of the "good old days", when life was more carefree, albeit with a lower standard of living and political monogamy, but without existential fears. To my generation, Tito was a great leader who was forged into heroic heights for us with stories and songs, but personally he is best remembered for his illness, his treatment at the Clinical Centre and his magnificent funeral. I no longer had any special emotional relationship with him: when I spent a good year in Belgrade a few years later in the army, I was not drawn to the House of Flowers, even though Slovenians like to go there. For the younger generations, our children, Tito is a textbook historical figure who led Yugoslavia, or the SFRY, and they need to think hard to remember what that acronym even means.
__label__subjective Three Men in a Boat, not to mention the dog, is definitely one of the most entertaining books I've ever read. Jerome Flap Jerome hooks the reader right from the start. After all, a story about three hypochondriacs cannot be boring. And so what when someone has every known disease in this world, except the knee of a snapper. Jerome concluded something like this: ' At first I was quite hurt by it, it seemed like a kind of insult. Why don't I have a knee? Why this unjust neglect? But after a while, less British feelings prevailed. I said to myself: I have all the other diseases known to pharmacology and, becoming less selfish, I decided that I would get along without a knee. Gout had apparently attacked me in the worst possible form, and without realising it gallstones had apparently plagued me from a young age. After the gallstones, there was no more illness, so I decided that there was nothing else wrong with me.'<p/> So the three friends set off on a 'boating' trip down the Thames, peppered with all the adventures that can befall a traveller. And many astute observations - such as why women shouldn't pull boats, or what happens to ladies who go on picnics in their best dresses. And last but not least, the eternal philosophical question: why do we always work more than everyone around us? <p/> A book that is so hugely entertaining and realistically pacy that it is a must-read.
__label__objective Resources <p/> Genealogy discovers and records personal information about individuals and, according to their relationship to each other, groups them together in family links in a specific time and place. In this study, the genealogist intervenes in history and relates family history to the general history, so he or she must at least be familiar with its landmarks and characteristics, such as: <p/> The language and scripts used in the archival material. <p/> Coats of arms and emblems used e.g. on seals, medals, coins. <p/> State and church arrangements. <p/> Customs and customs of society. <p/> Written and other sources of information (e.g. gravestones, votive stones, monuments). <p/> There is a very wide and varied range of genealogical resources and tools of all kinds on the web. You can find them by searching for general keywords such as: genealogy, genealogy, family tree, etc., or by narrowing your search to more specific search terms. Genealogical research generates a large amount of data which, without software support, is difficult to organise into meaningful wholes shortly after the genealogist has researched his or her immediate family. <p/> In Slovenia, Brother's Keeper is still the most popular genealogy software. It has the advantage over others of being translated into Slovene and of supporting the special characters of our alphabet. Among the more modern programmes, the more modern Family Tree Builder (FTB) My Heritage meets these requirements, and there may be others. The procedure for downloading a BK programme from the web is presented in two parts - downloading and adapting. The procedure is also described on the Slovenian Genealogy page, where there are many other useful links. <p/> A pointer to many genealogical resources has been provided by some of the more active genealogists on their websites. For example, colleagues Fonda and Zavodnik. The most complete worldwide genealogical signpost is certainly www.cyndislist.com. Among the domestic resources, we should mention SiStory, where some special issues of the journal Trees have been published, DLib, where, among others, the Lexicon of the Drava Banovina is published, and Kamra (Digitised Cultural Heritage of Slovenian Landscapes). <p/> For searching for persons abroad, there are worldwide genealogical data repositories such as Ancestry. A similar site is FamilySearch. Among European sites, the French Geneanet site and the German Association site are probably the most popular. However, to support the search for ancestors via the World Wide Web and the permanent storage of personal data specific to genealogy, web giants such as Google and Facebook are increasingly getting involved, storing a lot of personal data about their users, which will be the source of future genealogists. <p/> Genealogy is not a young science. The oldest genealogical works are the books of the Bible of the Old Testament. However, most of the old genealogies survive from the ancient world for the royal families and nobility. Genealogical research is another thing that is accessible to everyone in the modern age. May the guidance on our website serve you well.
__label__objective Anaemia is a dangerous companion to cancer <p/> General fatigue, weakness, poor concentration, depression, shortness of breath even with slight exertion, palpitations or a pounding sensation in the chest, retention of fluid in the body with the appearance of swelling, poor digestion and circulation all have a common denominator in cancer patients - anaemia. Anaemia, as anaemia may also be called, is not necessarily a consequence of cancer or its treatment, but can also be caused by a number of other, less serious, causes. However, it is often a poor blood count, with a reduced number of red blood cells (erythrocytes), which are responsible for "transporting" oxygen around the body to all cells, that can significantly worsen the life of cancer patients. <p/> The problems are particularly evident in blood and haematopoietic cancers, where anaemia "comes with the territory" of the disease. In some other cancers, however, anaemia occurs later, as a result of treatment of the cancer with chemotherapy and/or ionising radiation. One form of blood cancer is disseminated plasmacytoma, in which cancerous plasmacytoma cells grow in the red bone marrow of the flat bones, which is also the main site of production of healthy blood cells. "The cancer cells invade the bone marrow and do not allow the healthy blood cells to develop," explains Dr Irena Preložnik Zupan, MD, PhD, a specialist in internal medicine at the Clinical Department of Haematology. <p/> "When we want to define anaemia more precisely, we usually use the haemoglobin concentration in the blood. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), we speak of anaemia when the haemoglobin concentration in the blood is below 120 g/L for women and below 130 g/L for men," explains Preložnik Zupanova. Anaemia is divided into mild, moderate and severe forms. The former is defined as a haemoglobin concentration of between 100 and 120 g/L, the latter is between 80 and 100 g/L, and below 80 g/L is the severe form of anaemia, which usually causes the most problems, especially if it is rapid onset. <p/> "In all cancer patients, we also check the basic blood count and anaemia is virtually impossible to miss. Often, however, the milder form of anaemia in cancer patients is somewhat neglected, but the patient's well-being and quality of life can be significantly impaired as a result. The patient is already experiencing fatigue, feeling unwell, unable to do everyday things, intimacy with a partner is impaired, unable to participate in family responsibilities, etc. All these symptoms can be present even in mild forms of anaemia," she warns. <p/> The causes of anaemia in cancer patients can be divided into three groups: <p/> (1) related to the cancer, where there is significant bone marrow involvement, <p/> (2) due to the treatment of the cancer with chemotherapy and/or radiation, as well as surgery, which can lead to blood loss, <p/> (3) and (4) a third group of causes can be associated diseases that the cancer patient has and, of course, also have an additional impact on the anaemia. <p/> "If the heart is failing, we have poor blood circulation, if the lungs are diseased, there is insufficient oxygen supply, if the kidneys are not functioning well, toxic substances accumulate in the body and the organism is weakened," says Preložnik Zupanova. <p/> "Cancer-related fatigue is a common phenomenon - a strange, constant feeling of general, severe tiredness, listlessness and helplessness, which cancer patients themselves attach much more importance to than doctors," explains Preložnik Zupanova, explaining the difference between the patient's and the doctor's perception of the problem. "Also very important are the data showing the reduced success of cancer treatment in anaemic patients and the reduced survival of these patients compared to non-anaemic patients, irrespective of the type of cancer. " <p/> And how common is anaemia in cancer patients? <p/> "Based on the large 2001-2002 European Cancer Anemia Survey (ECAS) study of around 15,000 cancer patients, which looked at the incidence, prevalence and treatment of anaemia, anaemia was present in an average of 40% of patients at the time of enrolment, and in disseminated plasmacytoma, anaemia was present in two-thirds of patients at diagnosis. With cancer treatment, anaemia occurred in a further 30%", says Preložnik Zupanova. <p/> Anaemia in cancer patients can be treated in several ways, depending on the cause. "If a patient has severe problems due to anaemia, in terms of dyspnoea (breathing difficulties) or chest pain (a sign of ischaemic heart disease), we need to intervene with transfusions of concentrated red blood cells, which have an immediate effect. Usually these are patients with a severe degree of anaemia, haemoglobin concentration below 80 g/L. However, problems may occur earlier if the patient has associated heart or lung disease. Transfusion is also needed in patients who are actively bleeding due to cancer or if a previous attempt at erythropoietin treatment has been ineffective. In patients with mild and moderate anaemia, however, we prefer to treat with recombinant erythropoietins. The disadvantage is that it takes time for the haemoglobin concentration to rise, but it certainly avoids many of the disadvantages of transfusion," explains Zupanova. <p/> "Studies are still ongoing to determine at which haemoglobin level it is best to start treating the patient, with what doses of erythropoietin and how often. In our hospital, we treat with erythropoietin when the haemoglobin concentration is below 110 g/L and administer it up to a target haemoglobin concentration of 130 g/L. At higher haemoglobin concentrations, side-effects such as thrombosis and arterial hypertension may occur. This in turn may put the patient at risk. "Erythropoietins have a number of advantages over transfusions. The latter still pose a low risk of transmitting infections, cause iron to accumulate in the body and increase fluid volume. Immune reactions after transfusion can also be dangerous. The patient should receive a transfusion of concentrated erythrocytes in hospital for observation and appropriate management if problems arise. When treated with erythropoietins, these problems are avoided. The drug is usually in syringes for subcutaneous administration. Patients should be followed up regularly every four weeks to see how well the treatment is working. We are usually successful in patients who need the drug temporarily because of chemotherapy," explains Preložnik Zupanova. "If we have a patient with advanced cancer, we mainly opt for transfusions of concentrated erythrocytes, as erythropoietins are ineffective in this case. "
__label__objective Petrol cleaner than diesel <p/> Fuel. Researchers have confirmed - diesel is more polluting. <p/> A study by scientists at the University of California has shown that the exhaust gases produced when diesel is burned in cars pollute the atmosphere much more than the exhaust gases produced when petrol is burned. A litre of diesel burned in the US is estimated to contain 15 times more secondary aerosols. <p/> Secondary aerosols are small particles that accumulate in the atmosphere and can affect the climate, reduce visibility or harm human health in large quantities. <p/> According to Allen Goldstein, the study's leader, the results apply primarily to the United States and only conditionally to other countries, reports the German news agency dpa.
__label__subjective End of Leg 4 of the Volvo Ocean Race <p/> Wednesday 04 Mar 2015 <p/> All six teams have successfully sailed into Auckland, New Zealand. Leg 4 was very interesting. Tactical decisions decided the final placings. Two were crucial. <p/> The importance of the right or wrong tactical decisions had the strongest impact on Team Brunel's final position. They sailed the first part of the leg from Sanya, China very well. Before the Philippines, they decided to sail north, where the winds were expected to be stronger. The tactical decision was the right one and they swung into first place, sailing all the way to the equator. Brunel's skipper, Bouwe Bekking, said after arriving at the finish: "It's hard for a team that has sailed very well. We only finished in fifth place because of a mistake Andrew Cap and I made. The mistake we made cost us a good place. We were leading all the way to the equator. When we sailed with the wind to the east, things did not go as planned. The weather did not do what we expected. From the first place we had held since 15.2. we dropped to fifth on 22.2. And now we are at the finish line. For the second time in a row in fifth place. I must admit that I am disappointed. In the last few legs we have realised that very strange things can happen in a regatta. The differences between the teams are very small and many things can happen. That is the advantage of sailing on the same boats. It's just part of sailing!" <p/> MAPFRE was the fastest team to finish Leg 4. The Abu Dhabi team followed and the Chinese boat Dongfeng came third. Team Alvimedica came in fourth ahead of Team Brunel, and the last to cross the finish line was the SCA women's crew. Despite the teams sailing over 5000 nm, the difference between the first and the last team was only 7 hours and one minute.

__label__objective Renče during World War I <p/> A captured moment of the demolition of the Renče church bell tower during World War I in 1916. The Austrian High Command decided that the Renče church bell tower and the chimneys of the surrounding brickworks should be demolished so that they would not serve as an orientation point for the Italians. After the fall of Gorizia in the Sixth Battle of the Soča on 9 August 1916, Renče found itself in close proximity to the military operations on the Soča Front. The Austro-Hungarian line of defence ran only a few kilometres away from Renče: over St. Mark's Hill above Šempeter, the hills of Vrtojben and Biljen, crossing the Vipava River at Miren and ascending to the Karst past Miren Castle. The Italians wanted to cross the relatively low hills into the Vipava valley. More shells fell on Renče every day, and the village slowly began to turn into a pile of rubble. ... <p/> Renče Square during the First World War. The houses and the church show the effects of the bombing. <p/> Those inhabitants who had not yet taken refuge had to leave their hometowns in the greatest haste. From the newspapers of the time, we learn that they stayed in various places (Ljubljana, Novo mesto, Zagorje ob Savi, Loidelstahl in Lower Austria, Hollern, Gertaus and Pachfurt in the Bruck district of Lithuania) and camps (Wagna, Bruck, Steinklamm, Mlatz in Bohemia) in the then Austro-Hungarian monarchy. <p/> The interior of the Rhenish church after the demolition of the bell tower in 1916. <p/> Church and secular authorities also had to move.

__label__objective The Institute for Health Protection of the Republic of Slovenia (IVZ) and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Slovenia are participating in a large-scale European project entitled "Transmission of patients' key health information for treatment abroad" or epSOS (Smart Open Services for European Patients). The project aims to make key medical data available for the healthcare of citizens seeking medical assistance in another European country, while respecting the rights to the protection of personal data and privacy. <p/> As European citizens become increasingly mobile, travelling and working abroad more and more, they increasingly need medical assistance abroad. In order to provide quality medical treatment, the doctor abroad also needs the patient's vital health information. Modern information technology has long allowed authorised health professionals to access important health data collected in the patient's home country, based on the patient's consent. This is why many initiatives have been launched in Europe to create the right environment and conditions to make use of such technical possibilities for the benefit of better healthcare for European citizens. <p/> The epSOS project involves 47 partners from 20 European Union (EU) countries and three non-EU countries. The aim of the project is to carry out pilot projects to establish two cross-border services - the transmission of summary patient data and e-prescribing and e-medication. Therefore, the key tasks will be to organise the relevant legal bases in each participating country, to ensure an appropriate organisation of the work and to put in place the technical solutions. The initial phase of the project will test the feasibility and acceptability of the general-technical, organisational and legal coherence of the proposed solutions. The epSOS services, which include patient summaries and e-prescribing/e-dispensing, will be available on a trial basis in some countries already at the end of this year. <p/> Slovenia will test data exchange in 2012, probably first with Austria and Slovakia. <p/> For more information in English on epSOS, please visit the project website www.epsos.eu.

__label__objective Description <p/> How do Dawn Journey lollipops work? <p/> Dawn Journey lollipops contain ginger and peppermint extracts. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) helps to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with using a means of transport, while peppermint (Mentha piperita) contributes to the normal functioning of the digestive tract. For best effect, we recommend taking the lollipop half an hour before travelling. <p/> What is travel sickness? <p/> Seasickness, or travel sickness, develops as a result of conflicting information being sent from the senses to the brain. The senses are adapted to collecting information from an environment that is more or less stationary. When this suddenly starts to move when travelling in a boat or driving a car, the information reaching the brain via the optic nerve does not match the information transmitted by the balance organ in the inner ear. <p/> Travel sickness is much more common than it may seem at first sight. It is more common in children, but becomes less common with age. <p/> Tips for travel sickness in a child <p/> In the morning before travelling, your child should eat a light, warm meal. This prevents irritation of the stomach lining and contraction of the stomach walls due to hunger. <p/> Make sure the car is well ventilated before travelling, as bad air and heat aggravate travel sickness. <p/> If the journey is short, do not give the child food or drink during the journey. If he/she is very thirsty, he/she should drink plain water. Do not overdo the food. <p/> Place the child in the central part of the boat, bus or plane, on the centre line, facing the direction of travel. <p/> Do not give the child books or games, do not let him/her watch cartoons or films on DVD. When sailing on a boat, work and general lingering below deck is discouraged. <p/> Try to distract the child as much as possible during the journey. Try to actively engage the child in conversation or play word games with the child that require close observation of the environment as the vehicle passes by. You can also play a fairy tale on CD to distract the child. <p/> Try to remain as calm as possible. Children often feel nauseous precisely because they sense their parents' fear of nausea. <p/> HOW TO USE: <p/> 1-3 lollipops a day. The recommended daily amount or dose should not be exceeded. The food supplement is not a substitute for a balanced and varied diet. A varied and balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle are important. <p/> WARNINGS: <p/> Lollipops are suitable for children over 4 years of age. All ingredients in the lollipops are suitable for younger children, but younger children should lick the lollipop under parental supervision. <p/>STORAGE: <p/> Keep out of reach of children! Store in a tightly closed container in a dry place at temperatures up to 25°C.

This year, 110 photographs were received from more than sixty authors, which were reviewed by an expert jury composed of Žiga Gričnik (photographer of the Svit Photographers' Association), Nika Damjanovič (graduate in art history and comparative literature), Matjaž Očko (M2O, House of M2O) and Rok Deželak (RD2 Photography). <p/> The winners of the individual photography prizes were Filip Tokić, Saša Ribič and Pia Klančar, while the prizes for the opuses went to Iza Štrumbelj Oblak, Roman Rus and Jaka Teršek. <p/> The evening ended with a concert by Mihael Strniša and a screening of films made by the Laško Cinema Circle between 1964 and 1969, entitled Laško in Moving Pictures. <p/> Museums are a walk through our culture, our history, our past and if history is the best teacher, it is important to make the youngest ones aware of this, to visit the local museum and to walk through the exhibition, because it brings so many undiscovered things that we ourselves need to know about if we want to encourage and help local tourism.

__label__objective Overeating in secret <p/> Bulimia - an eating disorder in which a person is preoccupied with the appearance of his or her body and has a fear of becoming fat - which was only defined in 1980, is affecting more and more people. According to statistics, more than five per cent of the population officially suffer from this eating disorder, but in reality many more do. Like anorexia, bulimia affects more women than men, up to eight times more. Unlike anorexia, a person suffering from bulimia can conceal their distress for much longer than an anorexic person, as they tend to have a normal to moderate weight gain. The BMI of anorexics is very low, while that of bulimics ranges from 20 to 25. <p/> Huge amounts of food <p/> A characteristic of bulimia is repeated overeating, which occurs over a very short period of time. During this time, the person eats huge amounts of food, changing all the flavours from sweet, bitter, salty, sour... When he overeats, he feels guilty and induces his own vomiting, often with the help of laxatives and diuretics. Overeating and vomiting are cyclical, recurring several times a week. Most people who suffer from bulimia (75 %) belong to the so-called purgative type, which is characterised by overeating, vomiting and laxative use. The non-purgative type (25 per cent), on the other hand, indulges in fasting and excessive physical activity after binge eating. In bulimia, the person cannot control himself or herself, and therefore cannot choose the appropriate amount and type of food. However, it should be noted that most people who are overweight do not suffer from bulimia.

__label__subjective I had this operation this week. I wonder if anyone has any experience. How about cycling, after how long did you go back on the bike, I mean on a single, in the woods, not on the asphalt. Thank you lp hema <p/> Obey the doctor's advice. A lot also depends on each individual, some people heal faster, some slower with various complications. Definitely consult a doctor, but it is true that sometimes they exaggerate the time limit until when you should avoid exertion etc...but all this for your prevention... <p/> Thank you. I have a very good doctor and I will listen to him. But I am more of the get back on my feet quickly sort. We'll see. lp, hema <p/> I had this operation too. First I gritted my teeth in pain for two years, went round and round the docs, waited months for check-ups, was prescribed therapy in the acute phase, lost my job because of sick leave, waited for the disability committee to give me an opinion because of my paralysed leg, was hit by trampolines, rolled around the hospitals and received blockades, when finally they took pity on me and operated. Unfortunately, it was too late - the result is the destruction of the sciatic nerve from the spine to the end of the feet.I can't feel my left leg because of paresis, or I have the feeling of a "deaf" leg. The muscles have slowly atrophied and there is clearly no strength in the leg. I cannot wear a minica. My fendered foot bothers me a lot on the bike, I have no power, I can't get off on the left side because I fall, on the special I have a spd in the middle of the shoe because there is no power in the foot, and I can push the pedal with my whole foot (thank you Stan for redoing my shoe).Clearly, my kneecaps and leggings are constantly creeping down, because my foot is 5 digits smaller than the right one (the right one). It also bothers me a lot in cross-country skiing and dry running because with this wedge foot I have no push-off and it makes me kneel. I also have a limp, but it is not noticeable when dancing. The doctors immediately warned me that this tends to happen again. Well, it hasn't happened to me yet. Nevertheless, I ride a bicycle. I already had a bike with me in the spa after the operation and it was even recommended. Nevertheless, I ride on rough terrain, and sometimes I fall because I get sucked onto the wrong side and cannot catch my foot. I also find it difficult to carry a 15-kilogram bike, but it goes with a yoke. I also go to marathons (not yet disabled) cycling and running and I do have worse results, but I can do it. Even the sledging punctures haven't knocked me out yet. Even the stitched rags I wear at -12 degrees C can't get to me yet. I have spent a lot of money and time on various chiropractic and electrotherapy treatments to restore the nerve, but the neurologists have put me on solid ground - it's a lifetime. My therapy, my pleasure, is the bicycle. I advise you to do the same. But I hope you don't have any consequences-a destroyed nerve, because then there is no problem at all-get on the bike as soon as possible. <p/> Andreja, thank you, really thank you for these words. No, fortunately I went to a specialist (self-pay) after two months of pain and injections, and he immediately put me on a CT scan in Jesenice, and after 20 days it was my turn for the operation. So, I don't have the same consequences as you. But I know that my leg hasn't worked for a while and it will need to be woken up a bit, but exercises and walks and spa will do. Today is exactly 14 days after the operation and I am more and more hopeful that Franja will not escape me this year. If I may ask you this: Which spa have you been to and how is the bike- where did you put it? Thank you again, you really gave me the mood. LP, hema <p/> I was in Dobrna twice for 14 days each, staying in an old villa opposite the Health Resort. They had a "rumpr kamra", where I had my bike, a trekking bike at that time. It was not a treatment but a real relaxing holiday - therapies in the morning, walks in the afternoon, cycling around Paško Kozjak, around Šmartinsko Lake, swimming in the evening, playing cards with my friends.... <p/> Greetings! It's been three months since the operation and I don't have any major problems on the bike, in fact I'm still cycling the easiest, avoiding some hard downhills a bit. I don't have any problems with climbing due to hernia problems (I have them due to the kg gained during 4 months of total inactivity ) hema <p/> With back problems you need to spend a lot of time strengthening the abdominal muscles. And it's also good to keep them as tight as possible while driving. This is where endurance comes into play... <p/> Thank you, Little Mother! I'm working on it, my friend said that if I don't rest (I have to lie down for at least a couple of days, and sit as little as possible), he'll take me back to Jesenice. <p/> Why a second operation? I join Matičko's wishes. <p/> Depression thank you! The first time everything was ok. The second operation is on the other vertebra, or disc-my other leg was hurting, which looked a bit "strange" the first time, and has now developed to the point that I had to have "sub-urgent" surgery (from MRI to surgery in three days). Lp <p/> hmm; difficulty getting up after sitting; feeling "electric shakes" in one leg (along a nerve across the arse); walking, cycling etc. no problems; is that it? - will my aunt's hernia visit me? <p/>Miscolin, it could be something like that. I recommend you see an orthopaedic surgeon, because if it is not too bad you can cure it with exercises and massage. It's good to be examined by a specialist... Just don't wait too long because the operation is not pleasant. I went to an orthopaedic surgeon (in Kranj, he's really a master) because it's too long to wait. If you are interested in more, you can PM me <p/> To join the "hernia club" After a day's hiking, I got a low back pain. It wasn't entirely without foreshadowing, I felt a slight draft in my lumbar area right at the start of the tour. After the first long stop I found it a bit hard to get up but decided to continue. After 5 h of cycling I felt neither stiffness nor pain. I thought it was a happy ending. Unfortunately it was not. When I cooled down I was stiff in the lower back and the pain was spreading from the lower back all over my right leg. I was in pain for two weeks. A CT scan showed a herniated L5 disc. I decided to get it sorted as soon as possible so I am now in therapy. There is probably someone else with similar problems. I would be interested to know if anyone has resolved the pain without surgery. Of course, I am most interested in how it works on the bike. Does anyone use cosmodisk active on the bike to prevent back problems ? <p/> Just a layman's thought: maybe a good chiropractor could help you?If the injury is not too serious, of course, they don't do miracles anyway. Marko <p/> My mother was helped a lot by "stretching" her spine, if that's what you call it. She bought a special stand with a table on it. You lie down on the table, pin your legs together and turn the table "upside down" so that you are lying upside down.... 5-10 min 2x a day. She bought this table from an Austrian company... it's a medical device, so it's tried and tested. The result of using it is that the vertebrae gradually "stretch" by about a millimetre, thus relieving the pressure on the nerves. LP <p/> Well, after 4h months of regular exercise, the problems are gone; and the weight is off <p/> I hope for a similar result with both pain and weight <p/> The stretching table as Yogo wrote certainly helps. Otherwise, a beginner's Yoga class (1-2) does wonders. But it depends on your condition. Also, a chiropractor can do more harm if the condition is very bad. Start carefully. I don't doubt it, though, because you've already tasted the pain. <p/> that's it... the price is admittedly reasonable for a "medical device" but it's forever... the spine isn't <p/> ...a few days ago on a climbing trip I heard the story of an elderly gentleman who was put in a wheelchair by the doctors a short time later - he was already walking with great difficulty, his trunk movement was very limited, etc. The gentleman was an occasional climber, which he was advised against, like any other harder or extreme sport. His soul would not rest and he went climbing a few times. The catch was that the day after climbing, the movement was much better and the pain was less. He also noticed that the pills/hypnotics and other things "helped" him much less than climbing - now he tries to climb as much as possible, so in his old age he also enrolled in a mountaineering course and combines the enjoyable with the very useful for himself! There is something, or a lot, in stretching the spine. I had a lot of problems myself, the doctors couldn't find a solution, I was too young to be advised to have surgery, I was saved by a chiropractor (for a short time). Now I do more sports, I look a little more at my diet and it is much better. For the last two months I have done very little sport because of colds, flu and poisoning, I haven't swum at all, I haven't cycled, I've only climbed a few times... the problems are coming back!!! Stretching, yoga, sports that relax the spine help in my opinion... and it's even more "fun" than an operation! (all written here is my experience or the experience of my interlocutors) <p/> In my opinion, besides the stretching of the spine, the fact that playing sports moves the muscles that support the spine is also a big factor here. Marko <p/> I agree! That's my opinion too, but somehow I forgot to mention... <p/> Thanks for all the tips. The stretching table was suggested to me by a yogi a week or so ago and the stuff should be able to help. The problem is that I live in a block of flats and have limited space. Ever since yogo suggested it I have been thinking about what to throw out of the flat to make room for a table. Today I am on my fourth day of therapy and I have to admit that I have gained flexibility and I don't feel pain anymore. <p/> problematiks wrote:I really don't know what the problem is here.Bos did go to visit his mother, didn't he? Marko <p/> He had problems. 2x. The first time I got dirty with one of the exercises from aktivni.si, and when it was over, and the exercises were over, I got cut again. This time worse. I found some other exercises on the net that are a bit of a stretch, a bit for strength, ..., but from the beginning the dogs hurt, but it got better quickly. Now I do them occasionally, and sometimes (not during the exercises) I feel my back, but no problems. I can cycle, walk, ski, but it hurts when I swim or run (I get more discomfort, but I'd better stop) or carry heavier things (say, a bundle of raden in one hand). Lifting is not a problem. The injury occurs between the ages of 25 and 40 in about 90% of the population. The sheath is already hard, but the inside is still soft. Because of weak small spinal muscles, the spine collapses, and a "bulge" forms on the disc, which presses on the nerve. These muscles can only be trained with specific exercises, Kegels are very effective, and there are many on the net. I've put these in a pdf, if anyone wants it I'll mail it to them. Maybe it helps someone else, it helped me. http://www.aktivni.si/zdravje/sedite-na ... ani-bombi/

__label__subjective Man, have you read Of mice and man (men? )? Well, there's a guy who likes to slaughter everything that's pussy and squat and accidentally kills them Especially bunnies. Although, come to think of it, the Playboy bunnies... they're not exactly pussy but they're kjut. At least one thing about them is great <p/> nichiren ... I can get off too ... only with me it's the height then <p/> Shush, bless you, I thought you proper women were extinct. You're giving hope back to the female species to the poor busy bastards, such as me. And I have to agree completely with the theory of helplessness. And if any other metre-squat woman tells me that she would like to be "as tall as you", I will take her somewhere where the sun does not shine. That's it. <p/> Yeah, yeah - girls are always trying to be different than they are - some want longer legs, some want a bigger chest, some want fewer kilos. <p/> A lot of times it's just a phish for compliments <p/> but when it's not, well, let them all go somewhere! It's all about appearances and good self-image - you're all perfect, (especially my girlfriend! ) but so are the others - and Shushi, you project a weird self-image sometimes too! (I mean no offence, but there's nothing wrong with you, and you're not even a beak! ) <p/> @ Ace - helplessness? Absolutely, and childish naivety and all the "dirty" fetishes in general - but then does that mean that you taller women have to find some other fetish, say of assertive bosses, or teachers, mannequins, long-legged secretaries ... ... (I don't think you're wrong) - but above all, the short ones like to be tall and the tall ones short - let's be happy with ourselves, and that'll do it! (Tamale would not only like to be tall, but also busy) <p/> heh, I'm prouu looking at the tall types.I'm 5'4" and I'm glad it's like this, I don't have to bend down to go under the ramp, I don't have a back ache when I'm working, and so on. there are some advantages, apart from the fact that tall types like short women <p/> that's not fair, you see, it's not fair, splijohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! I'm in pain, I'm banging my head on the bus and everywhere else. And I look down at the guys from time to time, so my neck hurts again. But it's true that when someone tall enough finally comes along, I'm even more grateful <p/> I used to think that 69 was a normal size for a woman. Then I was horrified to discover that I am a gianormous (giant+enormous) womzilla (woman+godzilla) compared to the specimens on the street (no disrespect). Since then I have been struggling with the duality between the stereotype of beautiful tall women and the reality of the male race's preference for petite pocket venus. So yes - you have all the advantages of short stature plus the admiration and lust of men. Salt on the wound of the tequila, salt on the wound of the buxom - I agree that we always want what we don't have. You would think that both women and guys would be more aware of the absurdity of this situation.

__label__subjective The second man to climb all eight thousanders <p/> GL3 Post ID: 91944 <p/> Post ID: 39741 <p/> Diary of Jerzy Kukuczkà, a Pole <p/> WARSAW - The world's public has hardly known that another man has achieved a feat that only the famous South Tyrolean mountaineer Reinhold Messner has ever been able to match. Jerzy Kukuczka of Poland managed to do in "just" nine years what Messner took a total of 17 years to do: climb all fourteen of the world's eight-thousanders. <p/> Polish mountaineer Jerzy Kukuczka Jerzy Kukuczka of Poland is a true high-altitude mountaineer. He is a man who has left the beaten track, taken his own path, almost played with the eight-thousanders, and in the process opened up some new perspectives for mountaineering at such altitudes. "On 18 September 1987, Jerzy Kukuczka was on the summit of the 8046-metre-high Shisha Pangma and confirmed Messner's ambition of "one man on all eight thousand metres" as the second man. Like Messner, Kukuczka, a trained electrical engineer, was trying to blaze new trails: not the usual expedition routes, but much more challenging routes, some of them even in winter! Do the two super-climbers - Messner completed his round of fourteen eight-thousanders just one year before his rival - see each other as rivals? "I can understand the race for the most climbs, but not the race for the most eight-thousanders", the South Tyrolean commented. Was that really an honest word? In any case, the Pole also stresses that he had no rival in sight in pursuit of his great mountaineering goal. He even seems to have unlimited respect for Messner's success: "This man deserves all our respect; he was the first to climb all the eight-thousanders - some of them more than once". Sympathetic words. Kukuczek started with Lotse (8516 metres) in 1979, followed by Mount Everest (8848 metres). In October 1981, he himself climbed Makalu (8463 metres). A year later, he climbed Broad Peak, and in the summer of 1983 he climbed Gasherbrum II and I. In 1985, he succeeded in Daulagiri (8167 metres) and Cho Oyu (8201 metres). Kukuczka's ninth eight-thousander was Nanga Parbat (8125 metres). "Stations" 10,11, and 12 were - all in 1986 - Kangchendzenga (8586 metres), K 2 (8611 metres) and Manaslu (8163 metres). Anapurna (8091 metres) was the next in February 1987. Lastly, as already mentioned, Shisha Pangma in September 1987. On the summit of this mountain, a Pole bivouacked, brought his skis and descended to base camp the next morning! Jerzy Kukuczka lives with his family - his wife and two young sons - in Katowice. He is considered to be rather shy, he does not want to be in the limelight, he does not like television cameras. He has made a reputation not only for his own climbs, but also as a leader of mountaineering expeditions. He has always tried to get as many climbers as possible to the highest peak. On Shisha Pangama, he was accompanied by Wanda Rutkiewicz, his compatriot, who is considered the most successful climber of the highest mountains.

__label__subjective Washington Post: Snowden reportedly caused less harm than initial estimates <p/> National Intelligence Director James Clapper has assessed that former National Security Agency (NSA) contract analyst Edward Snowden has caused less harm to US intelligence officials than initially estimated, according to the Washington Post. <p/> "We are still assessing the damage, but it seems that he did not take away as much material as we first thought. There were a lot of things he could only look at, but he couldn't get them off the system," Clapper estimated on Thursday, speaking to the newspaper. He added that the damage was still extensive. <p/> US intelligence officials initially feared that Snowden had leaked data on the armed forces' command and control communications network. This was not to be the case. <p/> Since last year, Snowden has been making public embarrassing facts about the workings of US intelligence, from mass surveillance of Americans to eavesdropping on allied leaders and even economic espionage. <p/> All these publications have so far caused little embarrassment at the top of President Barack Obama's administration, but the essential damage is that the US is exposed as no better than, for example, China, which is regularly accused of hacking and spying. <p/> The US administration is not afraid of embarrassment, because it has already gone through this with the WikiLeaks releases. Intelligence officials are more concerned about whether Snowden might have taken something that could give other countries useful information about the workings of the military and spies. <p/> Clapper's assessment is probably very premature. The world's media have so far published only about 300 documents, Snowden is believed to have another 1.5 million in his possession, and his journalist friend Glenn Greenwald, through whom the documents are going to the media, promises that the saga will not be over so soon. <p/> There are therefore more than too many documents to continue negotiating Snowden's repatriation from Russia in a way that does not immediately put him behind bars. But the intelligence community and the government will first have to swallow their anger and resentment, and they are not yet ready to do so. Some politicians have branded him a traitor - and if he is also charged with treason, the death penalty is also on the table. (sta)

__label__objective [Claustra Alpium Iuliarum, tractus Italiae circa Alpes and the problem of the defence of Italy in the final post-Roman period] <p/> Abstract <p/> Recently, several works have been published that deal, either partially or more comprehensively, with the prison system of the claustra Alpium Iuliarum, its incorporation into the little-known tractus Italiae circa Alpes, and the large-scale problem of the defence of northern Italy in the Late Roman period. In the first set of problems, the author deals with the uncertainty of the dating of the military fortifications of the claustra system and with the late dating of the prison walls. He briefly attempts to identify the fortifications of the tract, which he sees as a broader defence of Italy than just a sector in the Julian Alps. In the last two sections, he discusses the chronology and typological characteristics of the fortified highland outposts, which take on a purely military character in a certain segment and in certain places, and points to a defence of Italy that extended in depth.

Tales from a thousand and one nights are intertwined with a thoroughly modernised culture that has only been connected to the Western world for 40 years. The greatest credit for this goes to the current Sultan Bin Qaboos, who built a modern country out of sand. Of course, he was greatly helped by black gold, of which there is no shortage in this part of the world. Although Oman has come up short in this commodity, as it has the shallowest basin compared to its other Arbian neighbours.

__label__subjective Yesterday's news from the municipality about the dismissal of two vice-mayors is still reverberating around Ravenna. It is likely that the Mayor's decision was also the result of public pressure. One of these was published in Dnevnik 3 days ago, where Mojca gave a detailed description of the situation in the municipality and its staffing, which is very true. Mojca Marot's article is published in full. <p/> In Ravenna, more and more people are dissatisfied with the staffing of the SDS mayor Tomaž Roženo, as they have loudly and clearly pointed out at the recent protests. "We have had enough of clientelism and nepotism, of immoral and unethical moves by our mayor," was one of the slogans at the only protest in Carinthia so far, which took place in Ravenna. After we wrote about the functions and remuneration that vice-mayors receive for their work across Slovenia, and highlighted the outcry from young Social Democrats in Ravne, several people from Carinthia who attended the recent protest drew our attention to this slogan, which was lost in the crowd. <p/> The two vice-mayors are brother-in-law and sister-in-law <p/> In a recent article, we mentioned that many people feel that three vice-mayors in Ravenna are too many for the municipality, given its size and the professionalism of Mayor Tomaž Roženo, and that they are also costing the municipal budget a lot. Rožžen assured us that he does not intend to give up any of them, as he believes they are crucial for consensus in the municipal council. But many consider this statement to be far-fetched. Two of them, Milan Škafar and Vera Krajnc, as Ravenč citizens have pointed out to us, are in any case members of his SDS party and, incidentally, they are also related to each other. Kranjc is said to be the sister of Škafar's wife, which means that they are brother-in-law and sister-in-law, while the third deputy mayor, Peter Oder, who runs the Eurosplet company (the Carinthian Student Service, which he and Rozen founded in 1999), is also a "mayor's" cadre. According to the Supervizor website, more than €3.6 million has flowed into this company from various public institutions over the last ten years, but the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption concludes that there have been no irregularities. In any case, the 22-member municipal council of Ružen is made up of 10 SDS party representatives, and if we take into account all those who belong to the so-called coalition, it is clear that Ružen does not need a consensus at all. <p/> Not political framing, but a reward for good work? <p/> "His actions are immoral and unethical, to say the least, and the main concern of both the mayor and the councillors is that they are appointing people loyal to their political option to key positions, i.e. to management positions in public institutions. Half of their relatives have already got a job this way," the people of Ravenč are angry. They are particularly surprised by the reincarnation of the Vice-Mayor Škafar, who is in charge of municipal affairs, but otherwise works for Metal in Ravenna. Some time ago, even his own party reportedly demanded that he be expelled and removed from all public office, but now he is once again a member of the SDS party's executive committee. Incidentally, shortly after the local elections, passions were already running high on this issue at one of the municipal councils in Ravenna. SD councillor Zlatko Halilovič raised his voice against the appointment of three vice-mayors. "We don't need three vice-mayors, unless it's political spoils for the SDS party," he said at the time, adding that councillors are accountable to all citizens, not just to the SDS party. <p/> SDS monopoly in public institutions <p/> The debate became even more heated when it came to appointing members to the boards of public institutions and companies, where Halilovič was joined by a few other supporters in protesting that they were dominated by SDS members. "Are you going to change the law of physics so that one being can be in several places at the same time? Nine parties have made it to the council, not just SDS, so it is right to balance things", Halilovic said at the time, referring to the apparent clientelism. The mayor and Krajnčeva dismissed the accusations, saying that just because someone is related to someone else does not mean that they do not have the right to be elected or delegated to an institution's council, moreover, it is a reward for good work, which was apparently also recognised by the voters. Yet it is strange that 23 of the 53 seats, almost half, on the boards of public institutions and companies are held by SDS members, some of whom have even been appointed to several boards at the same time. Robert Brezovnik and Dušan Dretnik also pointed this out, but were overruled by other members of the Elections and Appointments Commission. Surprisingly, even SDS councillor Enriko Plevnik was self-critical in the debate at the time. He said that "the list is really strange", while the Mayor said that the seats were distributed in proportion to the election results. These days, however, many people in Ravenna are very interested in who will occupy the director's chair of the Institute for Sport. The current first man of this institution, Aleksander Kotnik, also a councillor of the SDS in Ravenna, is moving to the helm of the music school. <p/> People are also wondering about the reincarnation of Milan Škafar, the Deputy Mayor, who is in charge of municipal affairs, but otherwise works for Metal in Ravenna. Some time ago, even his SDS party reportedly demanded that he be expelled and removed from all public office, but now he is again a member of the party's executive committee. <p/> One of the vice-mayors, Peter Oder, who is also a director of Eurosplet, d. o. o., - Koroški Student Services, refused to comment on yesterday's decision. However, he was disturbed by Saturday's article, in which we wrote that, according to the Supervizor website, €3.6 million had been transferred from various public institutions to Eurosplet - Koroški Student Services over the last ten years. In his view, this figure is misleading and casts him and the Mayor in a bad light. "Of this amount, approximately €2.84 million represents direct earnings of students. However, the recognised costs to Eurosplet over ten years amounted to only €128,000 or €12,800," explains Oder. He adds that around two thirds of the income generated by public institutions is generated outside the municipality of Ravne, while the recognised costs of doing business with all public institutions in the municipality average just €4,300 per year.

__label__subjective Rayo Vallecano 2-3 Real Madrid <p/> Real Madrid won three more points at the Vallecas Stadium in a match in which they were already 0-3 up, but then things got complicated when Rayo Vallecano reduced the score from two 11th-minute penalty corners in just two minutes. Cristiano Ronaldo put Real Madrid in front in the third minute after a brilliant solo effort, and Benzema then extended the advantage in the first half when he scored with a header. The second half started in the same way as the first, with Ronaldo, the current top scorer in La Liga, hitting the net again after just four minutes of play. As with Benzema's goal, Bale was the assistant for Ronaldo's second goal, adding two more assists to his tally against Sevilla. After Real's third goal, however, everything turned upside down for Real, as the hosts had two penalty corners in just two minutes, both of which were successfully converted by Viera. Real Madrid then regained control of the game and successfully brought the match to a close, with the players already starting to think about Tuesday's game against Juventus. <p/> Real Madrid visited the Vallecas stadium with fresh memories of the big win against Sevilla three days ago at the Bernabeu and the good second half performance at the Camp Nou the week before. The start of the match did not point to an exciting ending. Already in the third minute, when Cristiano Ronaldo launched a counter-attack, he passed it to Luka Modric, who gave the ball back to him with a beautiful pass, and then Cristiano Ronaldo first played brilliantly between the legs of the last defender Rayo, and in the final minute, face-to-face, he coolly matted the home goalkeeper Martinez with a shot into the bottom far corner to put Real in the lead. A super goal from the Portuguese, showing how in great shape he and Carlo Ancelotti's team are. Real doubled their advantage in the 31st minute when Karim Benzema headed home after a precise cross from the right by Gareth Bale. It was the Welshman's third assist in the last two games and the Frenchman's third goal in four days. The visitors gave the home side a real lesson in finishing, although the Whites could have gone further ahead after the first half after Real had two more good chances. Cristiano Ronaldo tried a volley in the 44th minute after a pass from Di Maria but his shot went wide of the post, while Carvajal's header was also just missed by inches by the Ruben goalkeeper. <p/> The second half, in which Illarra replaced Xabi Alonso, who is making his comeback from a long-term injury, continued in the same way as the first, with a Real Madrid goal. In the fourth minute of the second half, Bale was at it again, winning the ball on the right, breaking into the middle and passing to Ronaldo, who scored his second goal of the game to make it 3-0. It was Cristiano Ronaldo's 13th goal in La Liga this season, making him the top scorer in the Spanish championship. After a big lead for Carlo Ancelotti's charges, everything looked like a peaceful ending, but the hosts came completely close just two minutes apart. After clumsy interventions from Pepe and Marcelo, head referee Alfonso Alvarez Iquierdo twice pointed to the harshest penalty. Jonathan Viera was the better of the two in his duel with goalkeeper Diego Lopez. The home team gained confidence after scoring twice, and it was Diego Lopez who had to prove his worth in the 65th minute when he masterfully stopped a shot by Alberto Bueno. The hosts chased the equaliser until the end of the match, and on the other side Real had a couple of chances to score their fourth goal of the game, including two more attempts from Ronaldo that were saved by the Raya goalkeeper, but the score remained 2-3 and Real's ninth victory in the Spanish championship this season.

__label__subjective omron wrote. I have the following problem. My computer detects the key, but warns me that it needs to be formatted. I have tried formatting, but no result. I have opened the key and looked for any cold spots, but everything looks fine. I would be grateful for any advice. Kind regards. <p/> What now, did you or did you not format it? If you have formatted it successfully then use programs ala Recuva, PCInspector FileRecovery, etc. If the explorer sees it (that it has a letter assigned to it e.g. X) then do a chkdsk in the Command Prompt window with the command: chkdsk x: /f If the format didn't go through then let me know what you report! Do you see it in DiskManagement? Give me a picture. Format it with Rufus (choose fast format, of course). Then save the data. Which OS do you have? Try in the second, third usb2.0 port and not the usb3.0 port, etc. <p/> I haven't formatted it because it won't let me. If I press cancel nothing actually happens, but the cloud recommending formatting keeps flashing at 2 second intervals. If I open the "task manager" and look at what is going on at that time, all I see is the same application multiplying. This multiplication starts the moment I connect the USB to the computer and ends when I switch it off. Everything I have described is happening to me on Win 7 Ultimate. I have also tried it on XP. There the matter behaves slightly differently. I don't get any warning when I plug in the key. The computer detects the key, but when I try to open it, I get a warning that the key needs to be formatted. I didn't do this in XP, but I'll try it there as you advised. <p/> So, to continue from my last post in this thread. I have tried to format the key with the aforementioned Rufus program on both OSes (Windows 7 Ultimate and XP), but to no avail. I also tried running the key on all possible USB ports as you advised. The case behaves as follows. When I connect the key to my computer and open Rufus, the window from this program starts flashing at 2 second intervals. Nevertheless, it allows me to select "quick format". Then I start the formatting and after a good second the message "FAILED" appears in the bottom frame of Rufus and in an additional cloud "Error: Error while partitioning drive". I tried to save the data with Wondershare's File scavenger. When I started the scan, it displayed "No relevant data found! Please click Options on the right top and unselect Only scan unused sectors when scanning. Then try to scan again". I also heeded this warning and repeated the scan. Unfortunately still no success. I also tried CMD's "chkdsk" command, but it says "The type of the file system is RAW. Chkdsk is not available for RAW drives". <p/> I assume the USB stick size is showing wrong or 0. In this case it is not possible to format in low level format or any other format. All you need is to download the chipgenius program: http://www.usbdev.ru/files/chipgenius/ It reads the USB stick, with a bit of luck tells you which controller it is and where to get the controller reset tool. If not, you can find the tool on the net via vid and pid number. All other attempts to format will be futile and a waste of time. <p/> marko-x wrote: <p/> If I try to format a key with File scavenger, it shows me the size of its memory, but next to it it says Unlocated partition. If I insert a healthy key into the computer, it usually says "Drive F". <p/> Since the first post, I'm still waiting for an answer as to what DiskManagement sees... But ok, now you've come up with the word RAW yourself, which would be obvious from the DiskManagement image. And usually a right click on that grey box is enough to initialize the whole partition/size of the stick then the quick format and data rescue goes better with all the programs listed. If it doesn't, the controller has actually crashed. _________________ The greatest charm - electrician <p/> marko-x wrote: <p/> I used chipgenius which read me VID = 090C, PID = 1000.

Try safe boot (insert the stick and press F8 when you turn on the computer, select Safe Mode with Command Prompt), when you get to the command prompt, type: format x: (if x: is the letter assigned to the USB stick) Maybe the classic format will come in handy here. 3. Start Regedit (with admin rights) and parse the entry HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\StorageDevicePolicies then double-click on "WriteProtect" and enter 0 (zero). If the "WriteProtect" key does not exist, hide it; highlight StorageDevicePolicies, right-click, select New Dword, type Write Protect and Enter, then type zero as before. 4. Try KillDisk, which is primarily a wipe program and overwrites it with zeros (in the program, select your usb stick, tick "Select for Wipe/Kill", select "Kill", "One Pass Zeros" will do, enter the password "erase-all-data" and it starts gnawing on it. 5.

__label__objective The report (Feasibility study - Towards a mobility scoreboard: Conditions for Learning Abroad in Europe) contains a set of proposed indicators focusing on conditions to promote learning mobility in higher education. The Eurydice network has been commissioned by the European Commission to develop a set of indicators to monitor this process, as Member States committed themselves to promoting mobility and removing barriers to learning mobility through a Recommendation of the EU Council of Ministers in 2011, and the report represents the network's first attempt to establish framework indicators to monitor this process. <p/> The report focuses on the contextual conditions that enable, promote or hinder mobility. The study compares the situation in European countries with regard to the state of planning for learning mobility, the provision of advice and support, financial support for mobility, the portability of scholarships, foreign language teaching and language preparation, the recognition of study abroad, the special attention paid to disadvantaged groups of learners, and so on. <p/> The report covers data from 33 countries (all 28 EU Member States plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey). The reference year for the data in the report is 2011/12. The Network plans to publish the report every two years. <p/> The new report Physical Education and Sport at School in Europe outlines the state of play of physical education and sport activities in schools in 30 European countries. The report covers primary and secondary levels of education and offers insights into the following topics: - national strategies and broad initiatives where they exist, - the status of physical education in national curricula and guidance documents, - recommended class time for physical education and sport activities, - assessment of pupils, - teacher training, - activities outside the compulsory curriculum, and - planned national reforms. The report is the result of an in-depth analysis of the data provided by the Eurydice national units and represents the European Commission's first attempt to identify the key strengths and weaknesses of school-based physical education arrangements across Europe. <p/> Mathematical competence is a fundamental component of a wide range of disciplines, professions and walks of life. The Eurydice study highlights the essential elements of the policies, practices and orientations that shape mathematics teaching in European education systems, focusing on reforms of mathematics curricula, teaching methods, assessment and evaluation, and teacher training. It describes the measures countries are taking to tackle low student achievement and encourage students to learn mathematics. <p/> The study is based on a comprehensive analysis of the state of mathematics teaching and learning, the main findings of the international PISA and TIMSS surveys, and the results of the Eurydice pilot study (SITEP) on the content of initial teacher education programmes. The study involved 31 countries (EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Turkey) and covers the reference year 2010/11. <p/> A new report from the Eurydice Network, Funding of Education in Europe - The Impact of the Economic Crisis, provides data on trends in education spending in thirty-five European regional and national education systems between 2002 and 2012. The report analyses the impact of the financial and economic crisis on education budgets across Europe. <p/> The study Science education in Europe: national policies, practices and research is available in Slovenian translation. <p/> The study gathers information on science teaching in Europe and presents current trends, policies and strategies aimed at improving and promoting science teaching and learning. It lists and describes support measures for teachers and schools wishing to enthuse pupils about science. An overview of the state of science education, the main findings of the international PISA and TIMSS surveys, as well as the results of the Eurydice pilot study (SITEP) on the content of initial teacher education programmes are also included. <p/> The study involved 31 countries (EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Turkey) and covers the reference year 2010/11.
__label__objective News <p/> At a discussion evening in Novo mesto, Roma assistants said that the scope of their work exceeds the stipulated 4 hours a day and that they no longer believe in the systematisation of this profession in schools with Roma pupils. <p/> On Friday, in the atrium of the Goga bookstore in Novo mesto, a discussion evening with Roma assistants took place on the education of Roma and the importance of Roma assistants. The event was organised by the Roma Association Gypsies Once Upon a Time - Roma Today and took place as part of the European Youth in Action project. Bogdan Miklič, President of the Association Gypsies Once Upon a Time - Roma Today, said about the project, entitled "Centre for Media Research and Roma Coexistence", that it comprises a collage of events that will take place all over Slovenia, in addition to Novo mesto, in Ribnica, the Kočevje region and another municipality. "The project will include various workshops. Romani children will try out the role of journalists in Romani settlements, write short articles, and prepare short radio diary entries. The participants are young Roma, aged between 15 and 30, who come mainly from the Novometi region," Miklič explained. He added that they will appear in institutions that deal with Roma issues in one way or another. "We will also meet with high school students, we want to appear in police buildings, various schools, to create a bridge between Roma and non-Roma, to breathe together, to find a common language and perhaps to break through prejudices," he stressed. <p/> Miljana Mikica Gligič, a Roma helper with many years of experience, said that a Roma helper has a very wide range of possibilities and does not have to be limited to primary school. <p/> "If we were invited, we could also work in a social work centre, a municipality, a kindergarten, the state administration or the police," Gligič said. <p/> Lili Majer from Kočevje says she enjoys her work, but in the beginning she overcame her fear. "I didn't know how I would be received by the pupils, their parents and the staff at the primary school, but I have no regrets about taking this job," she says. <p/> Mitja Novak works as a Roma assistant at the Frana Metelka Škocjan Primary School. He has many years of experience. "At the beginning you feel responsibility and you have no feeling how you will be received. It took me three months to get used to it. I already knew the Roma parents and the children, but what worried me most was the reaction of the parents of the other children," he recalls. <p/> On Friday, we talked to Roma helpers about their work and Roma education. The discussion evening took place as part of the youth initiative of the Roma Media and Coexistence Research Centre, within the framework of the European Youth in Action project. Let's listen to a part of the discussion with the participation of Roma assistants Miljana Mikica Gligič, Lilica Majer and Mitja Novak. <p/> Ms Gligičeva explained that when she started this job, the condition for a Roma assistant was that he or she had a high school education and was familiar with Roma history and the Romani language, otherwise he or she could jump into the role of a non-Roma with the relevant knowledge. Subsequent applicants had to complete a 4-year course in Roma history and culture, mathematics, Slovenian and English. "They have been awarded National Vocational Qualification Certificates, but apparently this counts for nothing, as there is a younger generation of Roma assistants who are being posted to schools directly from the Employment Service, even though they have not received the relevant training. Their contract does not say that they will work on teaching assistance, but on socialisation and integration of Roma," Gligic does not see how to mobilise Roma assistants in a different way. <p/> Novak adds that a condition for becoming a Roma assistant should be a certificate of national vocational qualification. "The Ministry of Education has made this a condition for us to be able to continue to do this work, but things remain unresolved, even though it is the sixth year since we completed the training for Roma assistants," Novak notes. <p/> Mitja Novak believes that the Ministry of Education can provide answers in this regard, while Lilica Majer believes that the management of the People's University of Kočevje, which is the managing partner of the project "Successful Integration of Roma into Education II", which is developing and implementing the activities of the Roma assistant, would know more about this. Ms Miljana Mikica Gligič suggested that additional information be provided by Dr Vera Klopčič from the Institute for Ethnic Issues, who was present at the discussion evening. She stressed the great importance of the trust created by the work of the Roma assistants and the need to strengthen the links between the various stakeholders in society involved in the education of Roma. The participants agreed that it would be a good idea to organise an extended discussion evening with the participation of representatives of the Ministry of Education and other organisations.

__label__objective Yogi Bhajan <p/> Born on August 26, 1929 in the small village of Kot Harkarn in what was then India as Harbhajan Singh. At the incredibly young age of 16, he was appointed as a Kundalini Yoga Master by his teacher Sant Hazara Singh. He was also trained in Hatha Yoga under Acharya Narinder Dev at Yoga Smriti, and at Sivananda Ashram in Rishikesh, he was inspired by the Infinite Truthfulness of Vedanta philosophy. He also completed his formal studies in psychology and worked as a government official. In 1968, invited to teach yoga in the West, he travelled to Canada and from there to Los Angeles, where he began to impart the knowledge and wisdom of kundalini yoga to the young masses yearning for self-realisation and free expression. In 1971 he became a master of White Tantra (Mahan Tantric), which releases a lot of unconscious negativity through guided meditations. In 1970 he became the main religious and administrative authority of the Sikh Dharma in the West. He worked to spread the science and practice of Kundalini Yoga throughout the West and to create a community of Kundalini Yoga teachers for the Aquarian Age. On 6 October 2004, at the age of 75, he left his physical body. <p/> "Your mind is your servant, your body is your vehicle, your soul is your home. Nothing is outside us, everything is within us." YB

__label__objective The thesis presents a new clamping arrangement for a welding robot. The thesis is a practical project. With the chosen topic I want to solve a clamping problem in the welding of columns at Arcont. The company is still welding on an old clamping machine, which is experiencing a lot of problems. The problems are in clamping, practicality, ergonomics and, above all, in achieving tolerances. Tolerance problems are caused by poor tolerances of the semi-finished products. The core of the thesis is the implementation of a clamping set-up in which the profiles are not aligned unilaterally, but are centred in the middle. The defects are distributed on both sides, keeping the final product within tolerances. The clamping fixture model is developed using Solid Edge V19 modelling software.

The visitors were the better and more aggressive opponents in the first part of the game, which they managed to build on with a goal by Peterka in the 27th minute and thus went into the break with a one-goal advantage. In the second half, they took a 0:2 lead in the 50th minute on a goal by Turha, but Radomlans had a ready answer. In the 57th minute, Ciriković reduced the deficit with a header, but in the last 15 minutes, Radommer completely outplayed the visitors and scored three times. Tirc equalised in the 78th minute, Cirikovic again for 3:2 in the 88th minute and Vrancic Nik for the final 4:2 in the 93rd minute. Congratulations to the boys and their coach Robert Majdic for the game and the three points. Next Saturday at 15:00 the B team is away at Kodeljev at Slovan and we believe that our boys can again manage to win three points. <p/> In the 10th round of 2. SNL the A team is away to Šampion at Arena Petrol. The Radomlans, who are very modest this year (only 5 points in nine meetings) and occupy the penultimate place in the standings, already competed in the first round and won with 3:0, but the meeting came at the right time again, because the boys would have boosted their confidence with a win after the draw with Krško and the defeat in Šenčur. <p/> And so it happened. Niko Snoj took a quick lead as early as the 4th minute, but the home team even led 2:1 through Škoflek and Čretnik, and from the 27th minute, when Avbelj equalised at 2:2, our team dominated the pitch. Just before the break, Smukavec took the lead with 3:2, Zalaznik scored in the 9th minute, a minute later Snoj scored his second goal to make it 5:2, and the final 6:2 was set in the 78th minute by Vrhunc Luka, who scored practically on the first touch, having entered less than a minute earlier, replacing the third goal scorer, Jernej Smukavec. <p/> Radomlans recorded their seventh win this season and with 22 points they are in second place, three points behind Dob, but they are also by far the most efficient team, as they shot 26 times, which is less than 4 times per game. <p/> Our second league team will face a big challenge on Sunday, 20.10. at 15:00, when last year's first league champion Aluminij comes to Radomlje, with a new coach Robert Pevnik, who was on the bench in Radomlje only four months ago.

__label__objective "Programmed Ambiance" shows the relationship between cardboard, ambiance and numerical programming. The numerical structure is the basis of the whole art installation, on its basis the artwork produces itself. The programmed ambience consisted of 2184 drawings on cards, which were embedded in 156 hanging mobiles, the floor was covered by a carpet about 40 m long on which the numerical programme of one of the hanging card series was printed, and a horizontal grid structure that was attached just above the ceiling. The gallery hall was thus divided into three levels. The overall ambience was based on permutations of full and empty space, defined by a grid construction with 286 points - knots that measured out space to vertical mobiles. The numerical program that determined the position of the mobiles was selected on the basis of all possible 11-digit combinations of the characters 0 and 1, with the condition that they are in the ratio 5:6 and that the rows so selected follow each other in the original order, starting with the most uniform combination (1010101010101) until the given space is filled. Odd rows of the programme are read from left to right, even rows vice versa. The mobiles consisted of four card-programmed series entitled "Ear", "Rifle", "Matches" and a series entitled "Day", which was also featured as a comic strip in Problems -PU, an issue devoted to programmed art. Part of the "Programmed Ambient" installation was also a "Programmed Carpet" on which a partial numerical programme was displayed. Programmed Ambient was first exhibited at the Moderna galerija in Ljubljana in April 1969, as part of the Atelier 69 exhibition. Iztok Geister described the notion of SERIES as: the Ohoian ideoagram as a network of two sets of things: the same and different.

__label__subjective "The police, with their dedicated work in unenviable conditions, continue to prove that the almost impossible is still possible." <p/> To commemorate the determined resistance of the militiamen and to protect our own country and our people, we police officers have chosen 27 June as our national day. Police Day is celebrated every year. This year's main ceremony, which commemorated the independence role of Slovenian militiamen, took place today, 27 June 2014, at the Police Academy. <p/> The ceremony was attended by the Police leadership, award recipients and distinguished guests, as well as by the families of fallen police officers who lost their lives in the war for the independence of Slovenia, and by police officers who were wounded at the time. <p/> Today, the Slovenian Police is celebrating more than twenty years of history. "In all these years we have become a well-organised and efficient institution. But today, unfortunately, without modern equipment, without sufficient staff, in old vehicles and facilities, it is stagnant. /.../ Despite the fact that the police have been driven by the reserve for quite some time now, we have recorded good operational successes in the past period," said Stanislav Veniger, Director General of the Police, in his speech. <He added that "we are living in a time when the demands of global security require us to move more decisively beyond the 'security in your own backyard' mentality. The world is getting smaller and smaller and borders are no longer impermeable. /.../ Fortunately, Slovenia is still considered a country with a high level of security. But security is not a given and it does not come for free. It takes a lot of hard work by dedicated, under-rewarded and stressed police officers. No one entered the police ranks with the idea of getting rich. But the motivation to work, derived solely from a sense of belonging and mission, is slowly losing its power. /.../ The police are certainly an important link in ensuring security, but they are not the only link. I am pleased to see that other authorities, also responsible for security, have begun to play their part more vigorously." <p/> The Minister of the Interior, Dr Gregor Virant, also addressed the gathering. He said that today, twenty-three years after independence, we could say that Slovenians are more satisfied with our police than we are with our country in general. "The police do not have the ups and downs of the state, but they are a bird in the sky. For many years it has enjoyed a high reputation among citizens, providing people with a sense of order, stability and security. Recently, more than before, it must be admitted, there is also a feeling that we are all really equal before the law. <p/> Today, the police are not afraid of anyone, but all those who have robbed the Slovenes and stolen Slovenia from them tremble before them. The police is a stable institution with tradition and quality leadership. As an expert on the state administration, I can say this. /.../ I have to say that one of the things that surprised me most positively was the extremely modern approach to governance and management. I have come to realise that there is, in fact, positive selection in the police in the choice of management staff. /.../ Modern methods of leadership and management, the introduction of good practices, the elimination of bureaucratic matters within the system, the establishment of smart performance indicators. These are all successes of which any organisation can be proud. Therefore, the leadership of the police force deserves a lot of respect and thanks for leading the police in the right direction. But leaders cannot achieve their goals without capable and dedicated colleagues, and the credit for the success of the police goes to every police officer who puts in the effort and achieves the expected results. So congratulations to all of you." <p/> This year we are celebrating 10 years of cooperation in Europol, and the Ljubljana Mounted Police Station, which we recently celebrated, is celebrating its anniversary. For the 66th year, the Police Orchestra has been delighting us with its delicate sound. Under the baton of Tomaž Kmetič, it once again enriched our ceremony. <p/> At ceremonies held throughout the country these days, meritorious police employees are awarded in their respective police units for their contribution to the promotion of safety culture and for their merits and contribution to the development and strengthening of safety, and individuals from other countries and other organisations are presented with police badges of cooperation. The highest police awards were presented at today's ceremony by the Minister of the Interior, Dr Gregor Virant, and the Director General of the Police, Stanislav Veniger. <p/> The Golden Police Cooperation Badge was awarded to Josef Erhard of the German Police for excellent cooperation in the field of car crime over many years and to the Slovenian Armed Forces for excellent cooperation over many years, which undoubtedly makes an important contribution to the readiness to carry out the operational tasks of the police. The award was received by the Chief of the General Staff of the Slovenian Armed Forces, Major General Dobran Božič. <p/> The Golden Police Shield was awarded to Martin Poharc from the Celje Police Directorate, Dean Jurič from the Koper Police Directorate and Vojko Rupnik from the Kranj Police Directorate. <p/> The Grand Shield of the Police with a Bronze Star was awarded to Marjan Anzeljc from the Police Specialities Administration, Simon Velički, Director of the Kranj Police Directorate and Mag. Stanislav Vrečar, Director of the Ljubljana Police Directorate. <p/> The Grand Shield of the Police with the Silver Star was awarded to Andrej Rupnik from the Office of the Director General of the Police. <p/> The Great Shield of the Police with a gold star was awarded to the Special Police Unit of the General Police Directorate, on whose behalf the award was accepted by its Commander Rado Abutovič, <p/> while the highest award of the Police, a firearm, was awarded to Franc Sablič, Director of the National Forensic Laboratory. <p/> We would like to congratulate all the award winners for their outstanding contribution to the safety of citizens and the reputation of the Slovenian Police. <p/> Today was also the Police Open Day, where we prepared an attractive presentation of the Slovenian Police for all participants and visitors. There was great enthusiasm for the passing parade of mounted police officers and their noble assistants, as well as for the demonstration of helicopter rescue, such as that carried out on many occasions by the crews of the Air Police Unit, who took part in the rescue of people in the recent floods in Bosnia and Herzegovina with a police helicopter. <p/> Later, it was possible to see up close what a police helicopter looks like, as well as how a crime scene investigation van is equipped, and what the so-called "blinda", which is used to transport protected persons, looks like. We also displayed a mobile police station and a Schengen bus, as well as a speed enforcement vehicle on the motorway, the so-called provido. <p/> The children were particularly interested in the equipment of the police officers of the Special Police Unit. They were fascinated by their helmets, shields and attractive stories from the protection of various public events. <p/> The younger visitors, in particular, were most excited to see the motorcycle police officers and to take photos on their white and blue motorcycles, as well as the police service dog handlers with their trained four-legged friends, and the mascot of Constable Leon.

It is true that the period from 2004 to 2008 was a very successful one, both in this country and in the world, but on the other hand, both in the world and in this country, it has been shown that high economic growth and prosperity are based on unrealistic foundations, that a giant inflated bubble has been created which has infamously burst. Slovenia, led by the government of Janez Janša, unfortunately made some big, irreparable mistakes in this "golden age", which are plaguing us today in the crisis: Firstly, it did not make the necessary structural changes in any of these favourable times, it did not invest enough in knowledge, research and technological progress. For example, in 2008, the Janša Government allocated a whole million euros for technological and scientific projects in small and medium-sized enterprises; now the figure is already EUR 14 million. Second: In otherwise good times, it has run up huge debts (e.g. motorways were built entirely on credit during this period), it has not reduced the deficit, and what is more, it has even increased it during these fat cow years. Thus, in 2008, gross indebtedness increased by 161 compared with 2004, or from 57% of GDP to 112% of GDP. In order to embellish the balance sheet of your term of office with the accounts, you were prepared to create and trigger a crisis of international proportions because we were not prepared to approve a fictitious budget surplus. The new Government and the crisis that awaited it as soon as it began its work was an empty treasury, nothing, a hole. What is more, the J.J. Government left the new Government full of uncovered bills for pre-election promises that had yet to be found through budget adjustments: money for the extremely damaging public sector wage reform, and thus wage increases that will give us a massive headache, money for student meals, for free nursery schools for the second child ... The previous Government could not have left us a worse bill of goods than yours, Mr Janša. And last but not least, it was the previous Government that allowed and silently monitored the granting of tycoon credits for management takeovers in the so-called state-owned banks NLB and NKBM, which our MEP Vili Trofenik first pointed out, but the information was hidden from him, Minister Bajuk dodged and then disappeared somewhere. Much of the high economic growth was based on credit-financed accelerated construction activity, which also pushed up inflation. Many companies, which were more or less strongly influenced by the state and managed by dedicated personnel close to the government of the day, got into trouble, performed badly and are today on the verge of collapse: Interevropa, Luka Koper, Paloma, Elan, Hit. Not to mention, in particular, the controversial operations at Dravske elektrarne (21 million credit to the Maribor diocese), Eles (financing of Canadian rowers, and Pavlin's Olympics), or the unreasonable decision to build a new building for the Ministry of the Interior, the absurd and excessive purchase of Patrias and a warship, the 200 million increase in the cost of the construction of Block 6 at TEŠ due to the delay in issuing the consent, the inadequate management of the construction of oncology, paediatric and neurological clinics, the new emergency room at the KC ... sad and wasteful stories, which I list with one purpose and one question: do the successors and creators and promoters of all this really have the moral right to criticise, to smarten up, to offer themselves as great saviours? Is it not all just a disguised manoeuvre to divert attention from their own culpability and complicity? The fact is that the previous J.J. Government is unequivocally co-responsible for the difficult situation in which SLO finds itself at the moment. <p/> For a long time, the SDS and the Government of J.J. did not want to and did not acknowledge the crisis that was already prevailing in the world. It was not concerned about the high rise in inflation, which we in Zares, especially our MEP Matej Lahovnik, have been pointing to as the first sign of an unhealthy situation in the economy. Last autumn, you were still saying out loud that there was no crisis in Slovenia and that there would be no crisis, you were doing everything you could to play down the public's predictions of trouble, and you were saying all the time that Slovenia would not be affected by the financial crisis. When the crisis was already here, when experts (e.g. Umar) were already opposing Virjant's public sector wage reform, Virjant was still pushing ahead, and it is precisely this move that has led to the most criticism from the OECD, which is why we are having major problems in the budget. <p/> J.J. said at the Brdo conference on managing the economic crisis a few days ago that the anti-crisis measures of the current Government are ill-advised, those in power do not know what to do, they should rely only on others. Are things really as simple as they are explained by omniscient saviours such as former ministers Vizjak, Grims, Černač ... The whole world is in crisis, the leaders of individual countries are looking for different rescue measures, groping around in the dark, so to speak: some things are proving to be appropriate and effective, others are like a shot in the dark. Even Nobel Prize-winning economists are not unanimous, economists think differently, individual governments look for different ways. Each country has to find its own appropriate way of dealing with the crisis, and in doing so we have to be aware that Slo is not an isolated island, that our economy, which is predominantly an export economy, is influenced by other economies. It is even more true that the resources at our disposal to deal with the crisis are very limited, and we need to think hard about what measures to direct them towards. Is the deliberate and prudent action of the current Government really a harmful delay? Are the measures really unwise, or is it perhaps just a case of recognising that it is really easy for the opposition to propose measures because it does not have to think about global finance, debt, sustainability ... Is it not perhaps just too easy to propose tax cuts and relief in all sorts of areas, while at the same time offering a whole range of 'gifts' such as contributions towards the purchase of housing for young families or a new car - nice, no less. But is it not better to help Revoz and the many manufacturers of parts for the car industry in Slovenia directly than to help the entire global car industry and, in particular, car dealers and car sellers in Slovenia.The Government has prepared a comprehensive response, and we in the Zares Group of MEPs support it. We believe that it has acted appropriately, with the first two packages of measures being prepared primarily to stabilise the financial system, ensure the liquidity of banks and provide funds for the normal operation of businesses. A number of measures were also adopted to ensure better and more efficient absorption of EU funds. The second part of the measures was aimed at preserving jobs, both by encouraging shorter working hours and by encouraging and increasing funds for development investment. The OECD assessed that the measures to help banks were adequate but not yet working. Much can certainly be expected from the guarantee schemes, which have long been blocked because of a veto by the Council of State. In the meantime, 1 500 new companies and 15 000 new jobs have been created with state aid as a result of the measures. We are now facing the coordination and adoption of the measures in the third package. The vast majority of them are generally considered to be good and appropriate. Slovenia needs to find the right mix of measures, given its specificities (e.g. the fact that it generates 70% of its GDP from exports), that will work on the money supply, on the demand for goods and investment and on entrepreneurial activity, but also those that will mitigate the social consequences of the crisis. <p/> A word about the broader dimensions of the SDS and its most exposed members. It is a deliberate action in several directions:first, we are witnessing an increasingly serious and threatening behaviour in the National Assembly, aimed at giving the impression that the functioning of Parliament is anarchic, uncontrollable, full of procedural evasions, procedural gymnastics, creating the impression of an emergency, deliberately prolonged debates, blockages in the work of committees, extraordinary sessions, etc. The Government's performance is portrayed as poor, inadequate, mismanaged, delayed, insufficient, based on internal frictions and inefficiencies. Behind such inflammatory criticism, there is a tacit hope that the Government might lose its compass and stumble into inappropriate and ill-considered solutions that could lead to even greater outrage. But we in the Zares Group of Deputies believe that it is precisely times of crisis that require a lot of talks, coordination, clashing of opinions and concepts of views, social dialogue... In times of crisis, the impression is created that we need a more firm and decisive, authoritative hand, and SDS is already offering it in a certain way. But such a hand can very quickly become a leaden hand. What is happening? People today no longer believe in moderate and reasonable solutions, they are not satisfied with small steps in times of need, they demand quick and radical moves. They are demanding that the guilty be found, that convictions and punishments be handed down, that the scoundrels be dealt with, that there be more order and discipline. And it is not difficult to invite such people, in need and in trouble, into the streets, to goad them against the real and imaginary culprits of their plight, and this is a wonderful warm bed, as Boštjan M. Zupančič says, for various forms of fascism, chauvinism and psychopaths of all kinds. And times of crisis are already known in psychiatry as a paradise for psychopaths. These are already very dangerous matters, which I hope will not be played out in the SLO.In your proposal for measures, you also set out your analysis of the crisis and said that capitalism will emerge from the crisis better, also in value terms, because of its flexibility. A very outdated and ossified mentality. Indeed, many of us are pointing out that economic growth and the model of prosperity that it generates, and that has so far guided global economic growth as a neoliberal and financial model, has not produced good results. It has benefited only a narrow, privileged group, with the rich getting richer and richer, the poor getting poorer and poorer, with capital and ownership privileged and labour deeply undervalued and humiliated and excluded from decision-making. These models were close to your government for most of its mandate (after all, you substantially reduced taxes on the richest, you did not tax wealth) and it was only at the end of your mandate that you started to advocate a social model of the market economy in the light of the forthcoming elections and the poor public image. The current economic growth model is therefore, in our view, socially unjust and, given the limited natural opportunities and goods and the disregard for nature, ecologically unacceptable. Politics also bears a heavy share of the blame for this, as it has been deeply complicit in unethical and immoral behaviour, where power and money have been the only sacred things. Quick money without work. And corruption has become socially acceptable behaviour and the norm. Unfortunately, it has also become rampant in our country and, unfortunately, it has become particularly rampant in recent years, under your government. <p/> Let me conclude my presentation of the Zares Group's views on the measures with a direct assessment of the proposals: <p/> among the measures there are many good, useful and appropriate ones, which the Government will take into account <p/> a whole series of measures that you want to present as your own are merely copied, regurgitated, and are taken verbatim from those already announced and published by the Government <p/> many of the proposed measures are clearly unrealistic, populist, and prepared in order to achieve quick kiss-and-meet-you-good-effects. <p/> While the measures were rejected as inappropriate in the Committee, we would like to stress that, for two reasons in particular <p/> Firstly, as this is only a consideration of the decision that the DZ supports the package of measures, but cannot intervene in their substance, amend or supplement them, the decisions as they stand make it impossible to consider and define each one of them. So in a way: take it or leave it - all or nothing. Is this really what the proposers are saying: that they would like to cooperate and propose to the Government, to help - but their proposal is such that it is virtually untouchable. A very self-important and omniscient move, so to speak. <p/> And secondly: it is an unstoppable and inappropriate method of mixing up normal and established powers between the two branches of government - between the powers that Parliament has and those that the Government has as the executive branch of government. Measures are not merely a matter of setting out a principled direction, but rather of providing concrete guidance for binding action, which is a matter for the Government. The Government must continue to be the policy-maker of the country, which must otherwise be bound by the frameworks set by the National Assembly. What the proponents of the measures are proposing, however, would fundamentally interfere with the role of the Government, even limiting and making it impossible. This, too, suggests that there is, after all, a deliberate dismantling of the three branches of government, as is also indicated by some of the amendments to the Constitution for the Second Republic that are being proposed at the same time. This is already a very dangerous game. That is why we in the Zares Group will not support the measures.

__label__subjective Comments <p/> Hey Martian, Confucius was a pretty cool thing. No doubt about that. But that's just the past, which has left a very strange aftertaste for many. I've got one myself, but I don't want to dwell on things that may not have turned out so well. All in all, it is a pity, because Confucius is part of history. <p/> I would hardly call Confusion a serious convention. It was two consecutive festivals, directed by one man with a group of assistants and helpers. I was at one of the Confusions and I can say - it was confusing, or rather cordial in its own way. It is a pity that the thing has died out. Such a fun festival is missing. The Convention is a balance between education, serious and fun. <p/> I am very pleased that you have chosen Celje as your first host. I was president of the SF club Constellation in the 1980s and will attend the convention if invited, either by e-mail or by e-mail. I can't believe that 32 years have passed and it would be nice to meet former members of Constellation. Anyone who wants to contact me personally can call me on my mobile 041-680-865 or e-mail me at gombac.milan siol.net <p/> Thank you for the note! There will certainly be historical matters mentioned at the Convention. If anyone who was active at the time would come forward, we would be very pleased. There probably won't be an IRC channel. But there will soon be a dedicated Sicon-conventio n.eu website, dedicated exclusively to conventions. <p/> * as Celje was chosen as the first host, we should not forget the (ZF) / / SF--Constellation club, which was active in the then MK in the 1980s. * SI.Con is ' more ' recognizable as " " Si.Con " ":) * is there perhaps already a channel on IRC for SI.con (and/or the Curious Dust Society)? <p/> Add comment

__label__subjective Sometimes when I go to Celje, I see it frozen in that bronze. With a suitcase. Then I go to McDonald's, and Alma just stands there and seems to have got used to the city. And the city has (at least a little) got used to her. It's been a long time since I found her. Or rather, she found me. That's what one girl, a fortune teller, said when I told her the story. Namely, Alma died on the same day I was born. Not the same year, but the same day of another year. She died in Sveta, I was born in Sveta. She was buried covered in white paint, which somewhere in Haiti, or wherever, means reincarnation. <p/>Of course, it would be foolish for me to claim now that I am the reincarnation of Alma Karlin, because I am probably the reincarnation of some perfectly ordinary animal. But it was crazy the year I dealt with it. I was the first one to find her and dig her out of oblivion. People knew her, some individuals, but I was the first to bring all the knowledge about her together in a documentary. Then they rushed after it, "Oja", they rushed. Feminists, actors, sociologists, literary historians... and they discovered her, it was a joy. But this has been happening to me all my life. I find someone or something, I introduce it to the public, and then everyone else takes credit. Because I'm an unambitious shit-baker from Svečina. <p/> Alma was then presented as a heroine, a theosophist, a traveller, a Nobel Prize candidate, blah, blah, blah. She was one confused lady who travelled around the world and kept yammering about why she was travelling around the world. Apart from that, she wrote badly, or rather mediocrely. And she made things up. And she was German and at least a little homosexual... For me, Alma will remain, the memory of the day when I was wandering around the ruins of her hut, there under the stumps of the Celje castle, and it was as if I was knee-deep in some strange, chaotic fate.

__label__objective WATERWELL IN RIHTAROVCI (RADENCI) <p/> Despite light rain, we inaugurated the restored village well in the centre of Rihtarovci in the municipality of Radenci - the 55th restored well within the Helios Fund for the Preservation of Clean Slovenian Waters - In 1999 Helios and the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning started restoring local wells in various forms of water sources - Rihtarovci is the 49th in the series of the Helios Fund for the Preservation of Clean Slovenian Waters. Rihtaštavlje is the 49th place in Slovenia where a water source has been restored with the financial assistance of Helios and the professional support of the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning - After the blessing by the parish priest Janko Ivančič, the oldest villager, Terezie Mauko, was poured her first glass during the opening ceremony, with which she proudly toasted the gathered. <p/> In Rihtarovci, in the municipality of Radenci, the completely renovated village well was opened yesterday at noon with a short cultural programme by pupils from the Radenci Primary School and in the presence of many locals and guests. This spring, the municipality of Radenci applied for a call for funding, which for the tenth year has been organised by Helios and the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning as part of the campaign to preserve clean Slovenian waters. The village well in Rihtarovci convinced the expert selection committee and the renovation could soon start. <p/> The fountain is located in the central village area, in a small park next to a chapel with benches near the main road Radenci - Ljutomer. It is two kilometres from the centre of Radenci. It is a typical Styrian fountain, built more than a hundred years ago and equipped at that time with a large wooden wheel and a wooden shaft on which a supporting rope was wound with two wooden buckets rising up alternately. It is surrounded by a traditional wooden structure and the roof is made of brick tiles. It lies on a layer of clay up to 8 metres thick, which protects the groundwater from surface pollution and is 13 metres deep. The interior of the well was originally walled with sandstone, which was replaced by concrete channels 120 cm in diameter when it was rebuilt. Some parts have been modernised, but it remains essentially a copy of the decaying well. A submersible pump with a tap was added to facilitate the pumping of the water, and the original stone trough. The villagers used it until the construction of the village aqueduct The water in the well is in the self-purification phase and is not quite fit for drinking at the moment. <p/> The village well is also a popular walking route for guests of the nearby Radenci Spa, and will be of interest to thousands of annual hikers as part of the "Three Hearts Marathon". The fountain is also included in the conceptual design of the local water trail "K stűdenci", which was prepared by pupils of the Radenci Primary School and awarded a financial prize by the Helios Foundation. The pupils active in the project are working to make the trail a reality in the spring. It has also become a teaching point for the ECO Water System project, which is being developed by pupils from the local primary school. <p/> The restoration work on the well lasted from August to October and was carried out, also as a donation, by local companies and entrepreneurs and, of course, by the volunteer work of active villagers. The participants in the works were Viktor Zamuda, Emil Šmid, the Misja brothers, Branko Weindorfer Construction, Anton Kotnjek s.p., SGP Pomgrad, Tondach Slovenija d.o.o., Radenska d.d. and Boštjan Nedog Mizarstvo s.p. The value of the restoration work is estimated at 6,000 euros, of which the municipality of Radenci contributed 4,000 euros and the rest was provided by Helios through the Helios Fund. <p/> In the neighbouring municipality of Gornja Radgona, the Slatinski vrelec in Ivanjševci was restored in 2003 with the help of Helios, and in the municipality of St. George by the River Ščavnica, the school fountain in Stara Gora was restored in 2005 with the help of Helios.

__label__subjective For brave people, bankruptcy can mean the start of something new, better, more prosperous and happier. <p/> But bankruptcy for a company or an individual does not mean failure. On the contrary. For brave people, it can mean the start of something new, better, more successful and happier. <p/> For myself, I still claim to be rich. Wealth is family, healthy children and personal health. It is contentment with what we have and it is happiness in the face of everyday joys and difficulties. It is vision, purpose and hope and fighting for all that we love. <p/> Wealth is not necessarily wealth for a company or even for an individual. <p/> A company's assets, or even an individual's, are not necessarily wealth. Wealth is a concern, it is a commitment to increase or at least maintain the value of wealth. It is an ongoing obligation towards employees, the state and others. It requires daily care to ensure that it is used economically and efficiently and that it creates added value from which employees earn their living. For this reason, and above all for this reason, asset owners and managers deserve special respect. Unfortunately, in Slovenia we are not at a spiritual stage of development in social relations and values to understand this. Too often people mistakenly think that wealth makes people happy. They mistakenly believe that people who lose their wealth also lose their happiness. <p/> But many people only find happiness or realise it when they do. It is only then that they realise that there are other things than the satisfaction of managing wealth and a business. <p/> These realisations also make my pain at the shipwreck of the company more bearable. After all, property is only a source of income for the owners and the employees for the necessities of life. If, for whatever reason, these assets no longer generate enough income to sustain life, they need to be restructured or repurposed.

__label__subjective Rafael Nadal of Spain, the world's No.2 player and arguably the best sand court player in history, defeated David Ferrer of Spain 7:6 (1), 7:5 in straight sets in the final of the ATP 500 tournament in Barcelona after a close encounter. Ferrer was thus left empty-handed for the fourth time in Barcelona. For Nadal, this is his 7th title in a row, as he has lifted the trophy every time since 2005, but did not appear in 2010! <p/> The two Spaniards have competed 18 times in their careers, 6 of them in finals. The win/loss ratio is 14:4 for Rafael, who has never lost a final against David! <p/> Unlike last year, Ferrer offered a decent resistance this time, but Nadal showed in key moments why he is hard to beat on the sandy surface. In the 1st set, both managed one break point each, Nadal saved 5 break point opportunities from Ferrer in 12 games, and in the end, he sovereignly won the extra game, where Ferrer won the only point. The first set lasted 93 minutes! <p/> In the 2nd set, both players lost serve 2 times each, until the last 12 games when Rafael ended the match with 3 more breaks. The second set could have ended in the hands of Ferrer, who served for a 5:4 lead, but he finished the smash badly at the net, putting Nadal back in the game and himself psychologically down! <p/> The match, which was played in just 2 sets, lasted 2 hours and 41 minutes! <p/> " For me, this was the toughest match on sand this season. David always takes you to the limit. A few points were a real lottery and then luck was on my side," said a modest Rafael Nadal. <p/> Rafael Nadal has thus reached the 48th ATP title of his career! <p/> " As always, Rafa. I've lost 4 times, but 4 times against the greatest, " said David Ferrer, who has already won 3 ATP tournaments this year! <p/> Only Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic have beaten Rafael Nadal in the finals of tournaments on sand so far... .
__label__subjective How does Daddy come into being? <p/>Fatherhood and motherhood are two emotionally completely incomparable and irreplaceable roles, which no one can replace and which are unique. A wife can never make a husband a father unless he chooses to do so and develops fatherhood himself. <p/> Every adult man carries within him the potential to become a father. What is more, nature has equipped the child with everything he needs to communicate to his father and mother how each of them should take care of him. With its smallness, softness, smiles, shaky cries and amorous glances, it arouses in the adult woman an irresistible impulse to lift the child up in her arms and respond to it, and in the adult man a strong impulse to protect and defend this creature. And this is the very foundation of parenthood. <p/> The mother cannot replace the father and vice versa <p/> The child therefore receives a different kind of validation and a different sense of belonging and uniqueness from the father than from the mother. Which means that even a father who feels well for his children and is tender and motherly with them cannot replace the mother, just as a mother cannot replace the father, however determined, organised, physically active and proud she may be. Therefore, a father cannot learn fatherhood from his mother and vice versa. He has to find out for himself, with each child, how he can be the best father for that particular child at that particular time and in that particular family, what that particular child needs most from him, what he wants to express and what is in him but cannot get out of him. <p/> The father-child relationship <p/> The father-child relationship is established from a very early age and is important for both the child and the father. Children are strongly attached to their father from the very beginning. It is precisely because of the differences in the way the child interacts with each parent that fathers play a completely unique and crucial role in the child's socialisation. Fathers play with their children, stimulating them physically and mentally and guiding them towards new activities. Above all, they protect them! The ability to create a secure home is the cornerstone of fatherhood. <The child associates the father with new experiences, with spontaneity and with challenges. They easily become interested in such a father and a reciprocal relationship develops quickly in such circumstances. During the first three years, the father's sensitivity, cooperation and support during joint play are particularly important in the child's later perception of close relationships. His sensitivity during play gives the child a sense of respect and support, understanding the toddler's needs for exploration and contributing to a feeling of competence. Playing with a father who participates, who notices challenges and who encourages the child to challenge, solve and explore, the child develops a sense of importance, uniqueness, trust and belonging to his father. <p/> Daddy does things differently <p/> However, many times it is very difficult for dads to watch mummy looking after the child, finding herself and him feeling awkward and unable to build such a strong and warm bond with the child. He cannot imitate her, because he can never do something like a mother, because he is not a mother. But he can find his own way around her, which will be just as reassuring and just as interesting for the child. This means that he should learn to change in a way that is most pleasant for him and for the child, that he should calm down in a way that calms him, that he should play and have fun in a way that is also fun for him and that makes him feel that the child is comfortable around him and that he can be proud of his father. Fatherhood develops separately from motherhood, the only common point being the partnership relationship, which, if it is secure and confidential, eases a lot of pain, distress and insecurity because the partners can talk about it. <p/> Mothers, tell your man you need him! <p/> Men are far from immune to babies! They are just as vulnerable as they are. Men cry too, but with silence, withdrawal, ... out of a need to belong. A wife can tell her husband to hold the baby, to swaddle it. She can tell him that she needs him. What is more, she must make sure that she is always relaxed enough to be with the child, which means that she also needs his help to get dressed in peace, to eat her lunch in peace, to take a nap if she is exhausted. <p/> Every normal man and father is proud if he makes his wife happy, if he protects her and if his child loves him. Fathers are proud when they put their child to sleep, when they feel how important, beautiful, clever and interesting they are to the child. Husbands can therefore very well introduce children to their chores, to their world, because the child will be amazed by everything, the keys on the computer, the screwdriver, a piece of wood, a book, everything that Daddy does will be sacred to him. When Daddy shows the child what he is doing, what he is interested in, when the child is able to "help" him, it will be a great honour for the child, and the man will experience his chores in a completely different way. <p/> Contact with the child is important <p/> The basis of survival today is contact, emotional attunement. If parents cannot provide this for the child, it is a great deficit for the child. It is very difficult to live with such a deficit in the world, because he or she is not good at relationships. <p/> If the partner is afraid of contact with the child (for example, if he refuses to change the baby because he is afraid he will do something wrong), the child's mother is best helped if she can put a humorous spin on it, e.g. if she dares to confide that this father loves her child as much as she loves him. This is the only way that the baby's mother will be able to relax around the baby's father and the baby and live her motherhood to the full, not in bitterness and anger at the baby's father who "chose not" to take care of the baby for his own sake, not because she is so incompetent. <p/> Parenting is learned alongside the child and making mistakes is not necessarily a bad thing <p/> Do not be afraid if you do not know everything at the beginning, if you do not know your way around, if you feel helpless. The child has everything it needs to awaken the right response in the parents. A child's nature is made to "teach" parents. You can only become a mother and a father by your child's side from moment to moment, not in advance or with the help of a book. As the child develops, so you develop with him as a father and as a mother. That is why the first condition for this development is precisely physical presence. Even if the mother develops a strong contact with the child, the father will have to develop his contact with the child from the beginning, not from where the mother came from. <p/> It is not at all good for the child to have a mother and father who think that they have to do everything right and that they are doing as it says in the book, not as it is written in the concrete child. There is only so much contact with the child before the parents have to develop new ideas, new words, coaxing, comforting and playfulness around the child. The child likes parents who are distracted and learning on the fly, and it is best for the child if the parents acknowledge this helplessness and confusion and know for each other that they can only manage what is emerging on the fly. A child does not need ideal parents, but parents with whom he or she can observe how they invent, how they create, how they find their way. It is a very good feeling for a child to feel that his parents are developing alongside him, that they are changing alongside him, not that they were perfect to begin with, so it is up to him to adapt to them as quickly as possible. <p/> Talk and cooperate! <p/> It is important for the child that the father is happy, that he has a lot of energy, that he is glowing, that she can feel in his eyes that he is alive. This means that he needs to talk to his wife about his fears and insecurities, so that they can talk together, figure out how to move forward together. The ability to confront feelings, to find new solutions, to be flexible and creative develops most easily where a man and a woman are safe around each other and do not make excuses for each other. Then the child will call out for more and more discoveries and will continually reward both father and mother with its own development. This will make them each feel adequate, creative and content, which in turn will help them to be more connected and trusting towards each other. Then both of them will be able to be more and more sensitive, relaxed and loving around the baby, and their relationship with each other will grow "unintentionally". <p/> Fatherhood and motherhood develop most fully where a man and a woman are able to work together. A man can only become a father when he has developed his masculine identity to the point where he feels what the child needs from him as a man. In cases where the father does not decide to become a father and does not enter the family emotionally and actively, and consequently the mother takes over the whole parenting role and tries to emotionally take over and fill the father's role as well, it quickly happens that she also loses contact with the children. Fatherhood is the father's sole responsibility and motherhood the mother's sole responsibility. We cannot destroy each other's parenthood, but we can make each other so bitter that we do not even want to look for a parental role anymore. That is an injustice to the child. Parents deserve to feel fully each other's parenthood, but even more deserve to feel that the child loves them and that they are capable of loving the child too. <p/> So let mothers be mothers and fathers be fathers.

__label__subjective Lithuania wins, National TV disgraces <p/> The European Junior Basketball Championships concluded yesterday after ten days of competition, with Lithuania winning. After an unfortunate loss to France in the quarter-finals, then to Germany for 5th place, our national team managed to beat Greece yesterday by a huge margin for 7th place. So, out of nine matches, our team won seven and lost two. I am quite satisfied with what the younger members have shown, because they still have a lot of basketball challenges ahead of them, but I am much less satisfied with the coverage of the matches on our national television. <p/> I have to admit that this was the first time I watched the European Junior Basketball Championships, as in previous years I didn't even follow basketball that much, but that changed with the 2010 World Championships. So now I watch our national team whenever I can and I can say that I have never been as disappointed with TV Slovenia's coverage as I was with this year's European Championships. The whole event took place in Slovenia, with matches in Kranjska Gora, Domžale and Ljubljana. The first match was played by the younger members of our national team on Thursday 12 July, when the championship kicked off, against Italy. I did not even know that the matches started on that day, even though I follow TV SLO 1 and 2 quite a lot, because I did not see a single announcement for the championship, as I did, for example, a month ago for the football championship or now for the Olympic Games. It seems that they are much more interested in commercials than in viewers, and the junior championships are obviously less important than the senior championships. But after the Italy game, the news reported: <p/> RTV SLO will broadcast the matches on TV SLO Channel 2 and on the web portal from Monday, when the second round of the competition starts. <p/> Quite interesting, as the competition took place in Slovenia and next year we will be hosting the 2013 European Basketball Championship for Members, also hosted by Slovenia. This deprived me of watching the three games on television, but with the upcoming championships, we could prepare for the best possible coverage in the future. As I mentioned, there was no trailer, and thus no major publicity for the championships, so I missed the first day of the second part of the competition. Fortunately, at least they were posting news about it on their portal, so I caught the end of the second match of the second part. From then on I thought everything would be fine, but it wasn't. I watched the very next match on TV SLO 2 HD and the coverage was so disastrous that I can only wonder what will happen next at the 2013 EP and what will the performance be like then. During the broadcast, the picture was interrupted several times so that only the commentator could be heard, and the footage of the last actions at the beginning and end was played with such a blackout that the whole thing was unwatchable. <p/> After the unfortunate defeat against France, when our national team was still in contention for 5th place, I was already looking for the next broadcast, but I could not find it on the schedule or on any of the channels the next day. There are actually four channels - TV SLO 1, 2 and 3 and the online channel, MMC TV - but none of them had the coverage that many of us who followed the championships missed. The most surprising thing is that after the end of both the 5th place match and the France race (which took place at a time when there could have been coverage on TV SLO 2), there was a clip of the European Football Championship, instead of which there could have been a clip of this match. Fortunately, for the last match for 7th place, they only arranged for a broadcast, which still (for me at least) did not justify the mistakes that they should not have made. <p/>I only hope that for the 2013 European Basketball Championship, coverage will be provided, not only for our team's matches, but also for other matches, because it is nice to see other teams playing as well.
__label__subjective Select category <p/> Broken spoke <p/> Miha, 26 March 2012 <p/> My spoke broke on a hike. Not a very big mistake I tell myself, I'll fix it quickly. At home I look at the spoke, which didn't seem to be anything special, the length is one of the standard ones I think. I needed a 1,8 mm diameter spoke, 260 mm long. <p/> I start to surf the web, but somehow without any visible results. Clearly a component that sellers don't put in the online shop, well at least most don't. Much to my disappointment, apparently such a spoke is only made by NASA or some top secret military laboratory. Without exaggeration, I called 10 shops in Ljubljana and I did not get the case I wanted. All our dear sellers have are 2,0 or 2,0-1,8-2,0 diameter spokes (the middle thinned), of course they wanted to sell me the ones they have. The 11th shop had them in stock and my problem was almost solved. Picking a colour would have been a bold challenge to fate. It is even the case that they cannot even order spokes, some of the friendly salesmen checked with the importer. <p/> Not that a colleague had a similar problem not long ago. He couldn't buy the spokes he has on his Specialized from shops that sell the same bike. Some time ago I was looking for a spoke for a Kono Stab, where the spoke is of three different thicknesses. The result was the same. <p/> Now that I've eased my mind a little, we can move on to the technical side of changing spokes, in video form of course.

__label__subjective Partition walls <p/> It often happens that when building a new residential building, we overlook a flaw in the construction plan or a wall cannot be built as planned. In such cases, partition walls can be the solution. They are also often used in commercial premises to enclose individual employees and give them a little privacy in their own little "office". They are a quick and inexpensive solution. They achieve good acoustic and thermal performance. <p/> Partition walls are constructed with a substructure, which can be wood or metal, on which plasterboard panels are installed. There are a large number of plasterboard suppliers that also offer water-resistant plasterboards. Such panels are used for bathrooms and other wet areas. For better strength, the wall should be covered with one to three layers of plasterboard. Stone wool is inserted into the substructure to provide better insulation. All plumbing and electrical installations can also be installed in the partition walls without being visible from the outside. Installing a partition is a completely dry job, which can be done even when the building is occupied. We can also install in partition walls anything we install in normal brickwork. So, with the right substructure, doors, cabinets, speakers and lights can also be built into the partition.

No II Ips 250/2005 of 11.5.2006). <p/> CONCLUSION: The revision is dismissed. <The costs of the audit shall be borne by the auditee. <p/> SUMMARY: (1) The sums claimed in the application relate to the payment of the insurance premium (SIT 62,155,660.00) and to compensation for the damage allegedly suffered by the applicant as a result of the non-payment of the insurance premium (SIT 61,516,094.55 and EUR 1,081,484.50 in tolar equivalent). On 31.5.1996 the parties concluded an insurance contract (the Contract) under Policy No 814552, which was governed by the defendant's 'General Conditions for the Insurance of Animals', the 'Special Conditions for the Insurance of Fish in the Sea' and the addendum to that policy. The latter provided for the escape of fish from the applicant's cages as a result of a wind of the eighth degree of force on the Beaufort scale (gale) as an insured event. On 5 August 1997 the applicant reported the escape of 224 684 perch and sea bass. The Court of First Instance found that a storm had indeed raged between 25 and 27 December 1996, but held that the applicant had not proved that the number of fish allegedly escaped from its farm (from the cages on Platform III) as a result. <p/> (2) The Court of First Instance dismissed all the claims in their entirety. The Court of Second Instance dismissed the applicant's appeal against that judgment and, upholding all its findings of fact and conclusions of law, affirmed it. <p/> (3) The applicant challenges the judgment of the Court of First Instance in its entirety by way of revision. In it, he relies on "all the grounds of review" referred to in Article 370(2)(1), (2) and (3) of the Civil Procedure Act (C.P.A.). The Court of First Instance is asked to uphold the review and to alter the judgment of the Court of First Instance by granting the claims in the action or, in the alternative, to set aside the judgments of the Courts of First Instance and Second Instance and to refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial. <p/> (4) The review was served on the defendant, who did not reply, and on the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Slovenia. <p/> (5) The applicant was removed from the court register after all procedural steps in the review proceedings had been completed, with the exception of the issuance of the judicial decision. This act, which is a procedural act of the court, is not affected by the stay of the proceedings on the basis of the law itself (Article 205(1)(3) of the CPC), as the second sentence of Article 207(2) of the CPC is applied mutatis mutandis (thus the Supreme Court's judgment of 19.12.2006 in Case No III Ips 42/2006 as an expression of settled case-law). <p/> The revision is not justified. <p/> (6) The revision criticises the judgment of the court of second instance for a fundamental infringement of the provisions of the procedure referred to in Article 339(2)(14) of the Civil Procedure Code. It considers the infringement to be, in general terms, that the (contested) judgment of the court of second instance "stated, contrary to the documentary evidence, some findings which contradict itself and which contradict the content of the documents or records of the depositions in the proceedings". This is reflected, first, in the Court of First Instance's finding that, although the applicant, when reporting the damage on 30.12.1996, stated that 'a certain number of fish had also escaped', this nevertheless did not constitute a notification under policy No 8, but rather a notification of damage to the platform for a quarry on the platform. However, in order to satisfy the alleged ground of review, the judgment under appeal would have to be so defective as to preclude its review. That is not the case. The judgment under appeal is, in that respect (the last paragraph of the second page and the first paragraph of the third page of the grounds of appeal), capable of being reviewed: it is in agreement with the Court of First Instance, which itself gave full reasons (the last paragraph of the third page of the grounds of appeal).  <p/> (7) It is also possible to review the judgment under appeal (while the plea in law relied on is not raised) in so far as the auditor criticises it for contradicting the view that the plaintiff was late in declaring the escape of the fish in the light of the Contract and the provision of section 917(1) of the Law on Contractual Relations (LCCR) in force at the time, and the view that it did not forfeit its right to the benefit of the Contract as a result.  147 of the case-file) can be read without difficulty as meaning that the circumstances of the applicant's notification of the insured event - which was unusually (and unlawfully! ) late in the light of the care which the applicant, as a professional fish-farmer, should have been expected to exercise, and in the light of the applicant's established capacity to detect a significant decline in the number of fish (a 53 % escape of the insured population) - were taken into account by the court only in the context of its assessment of the evidence. The applicant did not (contrary to Article 918 of the Civil Code) lose its right to the sum insured by reason of the delay in informing the defendant, but its claims were dismissed on the ground that it had failed to prove the occurrence of the harmful event. <p/> (8) Finally, the judgment under appeal is reviewable even if the alleged illogicality between the assessment of the credibility of the farm workers who testified that the nets were blown down by the storm and the fish swam outside them and the evidentiary assessment that the plaintiff failed to prove the occurrence of the insured event were true. The assessment of the credibility of the workers in question is only part of the assessment of the evidence, which, however, was also assessed by the Court of Appeal on this point, with clear reasons (see the second paragraph of the third page of the reasoning). The substance of that evidential assessment itself, which is disputed by the auditor, on the ground that Platform I was completely destroyed in the storm, making it untenable to conclude that the fish did not escape from the nearby Platform III, is, as a question of fact, outside the scope of the review (Article 370(3) C.C.P.P.) <p/> (9) The substantive legal position of the Courts of Second Instance and First Instance, that the burden of proof of the occurrence of the insured event was on the claimant, is correct. It is not the case, as the Reviser submits, that the courts of second and first instance insisted that the claimant prove the escape of exactly 224 684 fish (see the third paragraph on page three of the judgment of the court of second instance). Their exact number could, in cases such as the present one, be determined (for the purposes of the litigation) by means of Article 216 of the CCP, but under conditions which are not met in the present case. <p/> (10) The rule in Article 216 of the CCP allows the court (after the evidentiary proceedings) in the fact-finding proceedings to give a quantitative (numerical) estimate of the quantity given (claimed in the action) (money or substitute goods) of which it has only a qualitative idea on the basis of the evidence adduced. That Article expressly provides that the court may do so if the amount of the sum claimed or of the replacement goods is either not ascertainable without disproportionate difficulty or not ascertainable at all. Neither of these (necessary, not sufficient) conditions is present in the present case. The court's discretion in question is not a substitute for the litigant's duty to gather procedural material and does not relieve a party of the duty to plead all the facts and propose evidence on which it bases its claims (Supreme Court judgment and order, Op. No II Ips 250/2005 of 11 May 2006). Since the procedural material gathered in the present case does not substantiate the assessment that any fish escaped as a result of the storm at all, the discretion of Article 216 of the Civil Procedure Code is inapplicable. The courts of first and second instance were therefore correct in finding against the applicant on the basis of the burden of proof. <p/> (11) In so doing, the Supreme Court has responded to the revisionist submissions, which are of decisive importance. Since the grounds relied on did not prove to be well-founded and since it did not otherwise find that the substantive law had been erroneously applied, it dismissed the revision as unfounded on the basis of Article 378 of the CPC. <p/> (12) The decision on the costs of the review is based on Article 165(1) of the CPC in conjunction with Article 154(1) of the CPC. The applicant is to bear its own costs.

__label__subjective The trade war between the US and China has been much talked about in recent weeks, especially in connection with Huawei. As a result of the 'sanctions' imposed by the US, Huawei has lost access to some services running on Android, among other things. As these are applications such as YouTube, Gmail, Facebook, Instagram and the like, the future of this company, particularly in Europe, is, of course, rather questionable. Of course, Huawei will not give up easily either. Among other things, it is announcing a new operating system that is said to be compatible with Android, but 'even better'. Whether or not this will be true remains to be seen, of course, but it all begs the question of whether Android really is the only alternative to iOS and whether it is also the only open source solution. It isn't and it isn't. There are quite a few mobile operating systems that, due to the dominance of iOS and Android, you have probably never heard of. And they are all open source. <p/> And which are they? They go by names like Plasma Mobile, KaiOS, LineageOS, postmarketOS, one called Tizen OS, which is supported by the Linux Foundation, and there is also Ubuntu Touch, which is of course based on Ubuntu. Touch was started by Canonical, but due to lack of public interest, Canonical changed its mind and discontinued it, and a little while later it was taken over by UBports, which continues to develop it.
__label__subjective RECEPTION OF THE FIRE TRUCK GVM-1 <p/> On Saturday, 30 September 2017, the municipality of Sveti Jurij in Slovenske gorice was particularly festive, as we gathered at the invitation of the Voluntary Fire Brigade Sveti Jurij in Slovenske gorice for the ceremony of the reception of the new fire truck GVM-1. The ceremony was graced by the presence of the following guests: the Mayor of the Municipality of Sveti Jurij v Slovenskih goricah Peter Škrlec, the Deputy President of the Lenart Firefighters' Association Robert Mesarec, the Commander of the Lenart Fire Brigade Leopold Omerzu, the Deputy Commander of the Lenart Fire Brigade Franc Lakner, the Sub-Commander of the Lenart Fire Brigade and the Commander of the Sveti Jurij v Slovih goricah Fire Brigade. Gorice Robert Kukovec, Commander of the Municipal Command of the Municipality of Pesnica Jože Repa, Commander of the Civil Protection of the Municipality of Sveti Jurij Alen Breznik, local parish priest and dean Janko Goergner, representatives of the volunteer fire brigades from Benedikt, Cerkvenjak, Lenart, Svete Trojice, Svete Anna, Voličina, Selce, Gočova and Oseko; from the neighbouring firefighters' association, the event was graced by the presence of representatives of the Volunteer Fire Brigades from Jakobsko Dolo, Jarenina, Šentilj and Velka. <p/> The celebrations were introduced by a festive parade. At the beginning of the parade, we watched the bearer of the national flag, Alojz Žnofl, a junior firefighter of the 2nd level, followed by the firefighter's emblem carried by the juniors of PGD Sveti Jurij, Maja Kukovec and Nuša Najdenik. The parade was then led by. The parade commander was Robert Kukovec, firefighter newspaperman II, vice-commander of the Lenart Firefighters' Association and commander of the Sveti Jurij Fire Brigade, and his assistants were Uroš Črnčec, junior firefighter newspaperman I and Tilen Kristl, senior firefighter I. <p/> This was followed by the Lenart Fire Brigades Association's Platoon of Honour, which is made up of members from all ten Lenart Fire Brigades Association companies. It was led by Jernej Sinič, Senior Firefighter, and Ivan Divjak was the flag bearer of the Honor Platoon. <p/> The flag echelon followed. The standard bearers' echelon was led by Robert Črnčec, Firefighter's Timekeeper 1st Class, Deputy Commander of the home association. The flag bearer of the home association, Jožek Zaletinger, was at the head, with the youth flag of PGD Sveti Jurij, carried by Karin Najdenik, at his side. This was followed by banner bearers from all ten Lenart Fire Brigade associations and banner bearers from the neighbouring associations of Jakobsko Dolo, Jarenina, Šentilj and Velka. This was followed by the firefighter youth echelon, commanded by Alen Breznik, senior firefighter. Next came the members' echelon, led by Dejan Najdenik, a junior firefighter, 1st level. <p/> This was followed by the echelon of fire engines. At the head was a 1982 FAP vehicle driven by Jože Sinič. This was followed by the AC16/40 special vehicle, driven by Branko Črnčec. Next was the newer Mercedes Atego GVC 16/25, driven by Žan Krajnc. Other vehicles of the Lenart Fire Brigades Association and neighbouring volunteer associations followed. <p/> After the parade, all firefighters and guests gathered for the main ceremony in the tent in front of the entrance to Jura Square. <Before the start of the ceremony, the commander of the Sveti Jurij Fire Brigade, Robert Kukovec, asked the Mayor of the municipality, Peter Škrlec, for permission to start the event. <p/> In the introduction of the ceremony, the President of the Sveti Jurij Volunteer Fire Brigade in Slovenske gorice, Gregor Nudl, spoke about the activities that led to the new fire truck being among us, about the wishes for a new vehicle. As the acquisition of a new fire truck is a great financial burden, but also a joy and pride for the firefighters and all citizens, the Mayor of Sveti Jurij v Slovenskih goricah, Peter Škrlec, also spoke on the occasion of such an important acquisition for our town and praised the efforts of the Jurij firefighters for the modernisation of the fleet and the dedicated performance of volunteer firefighting activities. Of course, all the assembled firefighters and guests were also welcomed by the Deputy President of the Lenart Firefighters' Association, Robert Mesarec. <p/> This was followed by the official handover of the vehicle, during which the President and the Commander of the Sveti Jurij PGD handed over the keys to the driver and the vehicle's custodian, Andrej Sinič. The new firefighting vehicle was blessed by the local parish priest and dean, Janko Gögner, who wished the users of the vehicle a happy and safe journey and to use it mainly for social purposes and as little as possible for interventions. <p/> The ceremony of taking over the new vehicle was enriched with a short cultural programme by the Jurova Octet and the young accordionist Marko Igrec. <p/> As the purchase of a new firefighting vehicle is unimaginable without financial support, the representatives of the Voluntary Firefighters' Association Sveti Jurij v Slovenskih goricah presented a token of appreciation to all donors and godparents who financially supported the Association in the purchase of the new firefighting vehicle. <p/> We concluded the ceremony with a sincere wish for the Jurij firefighters that despite the new equipment, volunteerism, courage and helping their fellow man remain their values. <p/> After the ceremony, there was a social gathering of all the firemen and firewomen, followed by the entertainment part of the celebration, as our firefighters also provided the appropriate catering, and we were able to warm up our hands and heels to the music of the ensemble Hearty Musicians.

It is now a matter of days and a large sum to raise. Negative comments only minimize the fight to save his leg. This is about a little child, not some old grandfather.

Of course we paid, but ! ! ! ! ! At that amount, we are not even worth a Slovene translation... But at all... " our " opinion was translated before it was sent to Boston. But the opinion from Boston made it clear that they did not deliver some of the " foreign " reports ! Because they asked for this and that. The child had made those enquiries, and Boston did not know about them. So... Having healthy children is a great treasure. Many parents with healthy children are probably not aware of this. <p/>I hope that everything is really going to be the best for Rene. It's already terrible that he has to go through all this, that such a young child has to go through all this - and his family with him -... But, you know, there's one other thing I remember about Rene's leg: one child I know went to the orthopaedic surgeon from the age of 6 - because one of his legs was shorter. They followed him for quite a number of years after that. They observed, they did some tests. And then once there was another doctor. And he said that he needed surgery on the tibia (shortening of the bone on one leg and that they would see him another time to find out exactly what the operation would be. At the second check-up in about two months. But at the second check-up it was the old doctor again... who just laughed at the opinion of the previous doctor... and said they would wait. Well, now it's been more than 10 years since then and this person doesn't even go for check-ups anymore, and there hasn't been any surgery either. Fortunately, it was not necessary. My mother is horrified at the thought that if the previous doctor had been back for a follow-up, the child might have been operated on.... <p/>I hope you have so much to take away that it is very clear what is really best for Rene. <p/> # 16 <p/> AMelaTalic <p/> 1 <p/> Apr 28, 2014 <p/> Ana: we also had a similar experience when we asked for an MRI, because of the ligaments and other things that are not visible on the X-ray pictures, and the doctor said that when he needed it, he would order it. :( And the ZZZS offered us 25€ to cover the examination in Belgium, which cost 500€ plus transport, accommodation,... <p/> A few years ago we were looking for a second opinion for our child abroad... it wasn't free, we had to pay for everything and when I told the doctor who arranged it all if we could get an opinion in Slovenian, she said if we paid extra. The state should be prepared to pay for such things. It pays for all sorts of nonsense... :( <p/> There is a page on fb for Rene.... (no, I didn't make it)... there will be everything you are interested in in several languages up there all the time. You can like, share, contribute with conversations, support, or just follow what's going on (to avoid misinformation, eh). Link: https: / / www.facebook.com / helpajmoreneu <p/> Hi, I'm AMela, mum from Rene. If you know anyone who would publish the story, I am willing to publish all the exams, especially the last one, in which we are advised amputation as the only treatment option! Also Paley's report, in which 100 guarantees a successful reconstruction of the leg. I cannot influence the opinion of the Health Insurance Fund, just as I cannot influence the opinion of the people, there are all sorts of us, but anyway, as far as I personally know parents with similar problems, none of them has managed to take advantage of it so far! This is yet another ugly innuendo circulating and smearing such campaigns. In any case, I doubt that anyone would publicly expose the results, their child, all their personal data, in order to then go on holiday to Hawaii. Children with special needs need a lot of money on a daily basis. I will give you a trivial example: we have one pair of shoes every 9 months paid for by the National Health Insurance Fund, and that is at an extra cost of 40! We still have the first adapted pair of shoes since birth, and the child is almost two years old! How many pairs of shoes have your children already changed in such a period, slippers, boots, etc.? ? Not to mention children who have more serious problems such as cerebral palsy and so on. If someone guarantees me from the ZZZS that they will pay all the costs of the operation (180.000) + rehabilitation + stay abroad + travel expenses, I sign immediately and I donate all the money that has accumulated so far at the same moment to the association Joyful Feet (children with cerebral palsy), or to some other child who needs an operation and is not covered by the ZZZS. I have a clear conscience, and I hope that others can say the same. I have been deciding to tell my story for a long time, having considered all the possible scenarios that could befall us in the meantime - from rejection, to partial co-financing, even daring to dream that there will be someone who will pay for everything and I will finally be able to breathe easy and take the next step without this financial burden standing around my neck. This is about a child, thank you to all of you who are helping us and who will continue to help us, and if anyone needs any more papers, documents, proof, my contact details, address, telephone, e-mail are posted above, I will send them without any problems. Greetings, AMela <p/> The whole process is described daily by my mum Amela on her fb wall. She also has all the documents, not me. The health service here would only cover an amputation, which is what she was advised. But for the surgery abroad, they are squinting and saying that she will get an answer in (the legally required? ) 60 days. And even that may only be a fraction, a percentage. As for the rest.... the campaign is in full swing, the blog is just my modest contribution to the mosaic. <p/> Give a little more information. There have been quite a few cases recently where parents had the option of covering the costs through the NHIF, but still raised the money and then spent people's contributions on " their own ". To avoid this, I advise you to calm down a bit and try to publish as many documents as possible (refusals, decisions) so that people will dare to transfer money. If the case is really as you describe it, it is necessary to involve journalists and make the matter public (Tednik, for example). I write in good faith that something will come of it, otherwise nothing will! <p/> But would at least one of those who have 10 million in assets, or 5 million in cash in foreign banks and safe-deposit boxes (eh, Milan) at least donate 10,000 euros in aid? Will it work? It will be easier to croak. I guarantee him that he will die easier!

The costs of this year's festival amounted to approximately EUR 2.3 million, of which EUR 600,000 was contributed by the Municipality of Ljubljana and EUR 38,500 by the Ministry of Culture. <p/> Compared to last year, the income from ticket sales has increased by €160,000 to €750,000. The festival also received nearly €1 million more in sponsorship funding than last year. <p/> A look ahead to 2010 Although the 57th Ljubljana Summer Festival has barely finished, organisers are already working on next year's programme. If the necessary funds can be raised, Brlek predicts that there will be some big names on the horizon. "It's not a problem to get anyone in this world, it's a problem of money," said Brlek, adding that one of the best festival programmes in the history of the festival would need to raise €3 million next year. <p/> 13,500 spectators at Film Under the Stars The festival also hosted Film Under the Stars at Ljubljana Castle, which attracted around 13,500 spectators between 30 July and 20 August.

Today, Ravne is the largest town in Carinthia, the administrative, economic, educational, sporting and cultural centre of the Mežica Valley, and in many respects beyond the borders of Carinthia. The area around Ravenna has been inhabited since antiquity, when a Roman road led through the town. Roman ceramics, mosaic pebbles, bricks and money have been found on the site of an ironworks. Ravne was first mentioned in 1248 as Guttenstein and as a market square in 1317. The basis for its development was the steel industry, which was only able to develop further with the collapse of the steel industry in Črna, Mežice and Prevalje. The steel industry also developed very quickly, and in 1952 it became a town and changed its name from Guštanj to Ravne na Koroškem. The wider Uršlje Gora area with the Roman Spring, Prežihovna, Ivarč Lake and the ski resorts at Ošven and the sports park at Ravne form the backbone of the tourist offer. The focus is on excursion tourism, with an emphasis on the presentation of cultural and historical heritage (the Ironworks Museum, Ravne Manor) and natural attractions (Votla peč, Uršlja gora), the offer of sports and recreational activities in nature (Ivarčko, Ošven, Ravne Sports Park), and rural tourism or the offer of tourist farms.
__label__subjective Hit cheers municipality's drastic cut in land-use compensation for gambling <p/> New York city councillors will face a big dilemma tomorrow. If they want to help our biggest company, Hito, which is in serious trouble, they will have to give up a hefty pile of money. On the agenda of the municipal meeting is a proposal to reduce the land-use allowance for gambling by 70%. Knowing that last year, Hit contributed a whopping EUR 1.7 million to the municipal coffers, it is understandable why the Hit people are cheering loudly for the adoption of this measure. Employees, they say, have already contributed their share with the last pay cuts, and now the state and the municipality are on the move, since the decree assessing the compensation was written in 2003, when, as we like to say, the gambling industry was, as we like to say, churning out honey and milk.
__label__objective international protection - restriction of movement of an applicant for international protection - removal procedure - abuse of procedure - objective criteria - implementation of the Directive <p/> Core <p/> The presumption that an applicant has made an application solely to delay his/her return can be justified on the basis of objective criteria. However, the current ZMZ-1 does not contain such objective criteria, which means that Article 8 of Directive 2013/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on standards for the reception of applicants for international protection has not been fully implemented in the legal order of the Republic of Slovenia and, therefore, Article 8 of the Directive is directly applicable in accordance with the principle of primacy. Therefore, since the objective criteria have not been incorporated by the legislator into the ZMZ-1, it is not possible to restrict movement on this legal basis until the ZMZ-1 is amended accordingly. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> I. The action is allowed and the contested decision No 2142-906/2020-6 (1312-02) of 4 June 2020 is annulled. <p/> II. The application for interim measures is dismissed. <By the contested order, the defendant detained the applicant on the ground that his movements were already restricted as a result of the return procedure under the Law on the entry, stay and departure of aliens in the Republic of Slovenia, in order to carry out and enforce the removal procedure, and that it could reasonably be assumed that the applicant had lodged the application only to delay or obstruct the implementation of the removal procedure, when he had the possibility to apply for international protection. It decided that the applicant would be detained at the premises of the Aliens Centre in Postojna from 4 June 2020 from 15.20 until the end of the reason, but no longer than until 4 September 2020 at 15.20, with the possibility of an extension of one month. <p/> 2. In the grounds for the decision, the defendant states that the applicant lodged an application for international protection in the Republic of Slovenia on 4 June 2020. On 2 June 2020, the applicant was released from prison. .... The District Court ... imposed on him, inter alia, the ancillary sanction of expulsion of the alien from the country. As it was not possible to remove the applicant immediately from Slovenia, he was placed by decision of 2 June 2020 in the Aliens Centre, where he expressed his wish to apply for international protection on 3 June 2020, and his application was formally accepted on 4 June 2020. At the time of his application, the applicant stated that he had left his country of origin 4 years previously. He has not yet applied for international protection in Slovenia, but he has applied in Italy, where he holds a passport. He has been in Slovenia since October 2019. The applicant said that he was applying now because he had been in prison, and in prison he did not know that he could apply for international protection. Immediately after his entry into Slovenia, he was caught and put in prison. He was in Italy waiting for a decision on his application for international protection, but in the meantime he made a mistake and went to Slovenia, where he went to prison. He is seeking international protection in Slovenia because he is at risk in Pakistan. <p/> 3. According to the defendant, the condition for restriction of movement laid down in Article 84(3)(1) of the International Protection Act ('the IPA-1') is fulfilled. Given that the applicant had previously applied for international protection also in France and Italy, and then went to his country of origin and married there, and came back to Italy and then to Slovenia, the Court finds that by such actions he prevents any State from taking a substantive decision on his alleged problems in his country of origin. The applicant was also the subject of removal proceedings from the Republic of Slovenia, which he formally discontinued by lodging an application for international protection. For the above reason, the defendant rightly concludes that he made the application only with a view to delaying or obstructing the implementation of the removal. Since his arrest by the police on 11 October 2019, he has had the opportunity to apply for international protection, but has not done so. He could have made an application earlier and not only at the time of his detention in the Detention Centre, as he was certainly aware of this possibility in the light of his previous applications. <p/> 4. In the further reasoning of the decision, the defendant explains in detail why it is necessary to restrict the applicant's movements to the premises of the Aliens Centre and not to the asylum centre, where such a restriction of movement could not be sufficiently effective. The purpose of the restriction of movement could not be achieved by a less severe measure, since there are no appropriate mechanisms in the asylum centre to prevent the departure of the asylum seeker from the asylum centre. <p/> 5. The applicant brings the present action on all the grounds laid down in Article 27 of the Administrative Disputes Act (hereinafter 'the ADL-1'). In his application, he submits that he has been consistent in his statements throughout. He had already lodged an application for international protection in Italy on 2 August 2018 and before that in France (4 July 2017). In Pakistan, his entire family is in dispute with his uncle over land left by his grandfather. The uncle has taken this land and is now threatening the complainant and his brother. Therefore, it would be difficult for him to go back as he is afraid of his uncle. At the same time, he wishes he could sell the land and move to Italy or Slovenia with his family. That's why he applied for international protection here as soon as he got out of prison .... He did not lodge his application in Slovenia with the intention of delaying or obstructing his removal from Slovenia. His application is substantive and genuine and is not made to obstruct the proceedings. Furthermore, a measure of restriction of movement to the Aliens Centre may only be ordered where, in a particular case, a measure of restriction of movement to the asylum centre cannot be effectively implemented. The defendant could have ordered a mandatory detention order in the asylum centre, which would have been a proportionate measure. The applicant claims that the Court should allow the action and set aside the contested order and, in the alternative, that the Court should allow the action, set aside the contested order and refer the case back to the defendant for further proceedings. <p/> 6. The applicant also applied for an interim injunction together with the application, requesting the court to suspend the operation of the contested order pending a final decision on that order. The contested order infringes the applicant's right to personal liberty. <7. In its reply to the application, the defendant submits that the contested order is lawful and correct and therefore maintains it and requests that the action be dismissed as unfounded. <p/> Concerning point I of the operative part of the judgment: <p/> 8. <In reaching its decision, the defendant relied on Article 84(1)(3) of the MZM-1.  It follows from Article 84, paragraph 3, of the Law on the Protection of the Persons with Disabilities, that the competent authority may order an applicant to be subject to a measure of compulsory detention in the territory of an asylum home where the applicant's movement is restricted as a result of the return procedure pursuant to the Law on the Entry, Stay and Departure of Aliens in the Republic of Slovenia, in order to carry out and enforce the return procedure or the removal procedure, and where there are grounds to believe that the applicant has made the application only to delay or obstruct the implementation of the removal procedure, where he/she has had the opportunity to apply for international protection. It follows from the above provision that several conditions must be cumulatively fulfilled in order for this ground for restriction of movement to be established. One of the conditions is that it may be reasonably assumed that the applicant made the application only to delay or impede the execution of the removal, when he had the possibility to apply for international protection. The defendant based its presumption that the applicant had made the application solely for the purpose of obstructing removal on the fact that he had not made the application earlier, even though he could have done so. <p/> 11. The provision of Article 84(3)(1) ZMZ-1 implements Directive 2013/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on standards for the reception of applicants for international protection ('Reception Directive II') in the legal order of the Republic of Slovenia. The above-mentioned provision of the ZMZ-1 implements Article 8(3)(d) of the Reception Directive II. It provides that an applicant may be detained where the applicant is detained for the purpose of return proceedings in accordance with Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2008 on the application of the European Return Procedure (Directive 2008/115/EC). The Member State concerned may, on the basis of objective criteria, including the fact that the applicant has already had the opportunity to initiate the asylum procedure, conclude that there are reasonable grounds to believe that he/she is making the application solely to delay or impede the execution of the return decision. Furthermore, Article 8(3) of the Reception Directive II further provides that the grounds for detention are to be defined in national law. <p/> 12. That provision therefore expressly provides that the presumption that an applicant has made an application solely for the purpose of delaying his or her return may be justified on the basis of objective criteria. However, the current ZMZ-1 does not contain such objective criteria, which means that the above-mentioned provision of the Reception Directive II has not been fully implemented in the legal order of the Republic of Slovenia and, therefore, Article 8 of the Reception Directive II is directly applicable in accordance with the principle of primacy. Therefore, since the objective criteria have not been incorporated by the legislator into the ZMZ-1, it is not possible to restrict movement on this legal basis until the ZMZ-1 has been amended accordingly (Article 84(1)(3), first indent, ZMZ-1). The ZMZ-1 should lay down criteria by which it could be reasonably concluded whether an applicant has lodged an asylum application for the sole purpose of withholding his/her removal. Such objective criteria should also be laid down in the law in order to respect the basic principles underlying Reception Directive II. Thus, the introductory part of the cited Directive states in point 15 that the detention of applicants should be applied in accordance with the basic principle that a person should not be detained solely because he or she is seeking international protection, in particular in accordance with the international legal obligations of the Member States and Article 31 of the Geneva Convention. An applicant should only be detained in very clearly defined exceptional circumstances, as provided for in this Directive, and taking into account the principle of necessity and proportionality as regards both the manner and the purpose of such detention. <p/> 13. Therefore, since Reception Directive II explicitly provides in its introductory part that detention may only be carried out in very clearly defined exceptional circumstances, the criteria for presuming that someone has made an application solely for the purpose of obstructing removal must be sufficiently defined in law, and, as already explained, the current MHC-1 does not contain such objective criteria. The mere fact that an applicant lodges an asylum application at the time when removal from the country is being carried out does not in itself mean that he has lodged it solely for the purpose of obstructing removal, having regard to the fact that it is apparent from the data in the Eurodac database, which form part of the administrative file, that the applicant had previously lodged an application for international protection in Italy and France. <p/> 14. The Court further observes that the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia has already examined the correctness and lawfulness of the decision in cases X Ips 1/2019 and X Ips 11/2019 concerning Article 84(1)(5), first indent, of the ZMZ-1, which refers to Article 28 of Regulation 604/2013/EU ('the Dublin III Regulation'), and thus to the risk of absconding referred to in Article 2(n) of the Dublin III Regulation, which provides that the risk of absconding must be established on the basis of the objective criteria laid down by the law. The Supreme Court, in its judgments in the cases cited above, found that these criteria (despite Article 31(2) of the MZZ-1, which deals with the risk of absconding in a blanket manner) are not present in the MZZ-1, and that there is therefore no legal basis for the imposition of such a measure of restriction of movement. In the present case, the objective criteria for the defendant to be entitled to reasonably assume that the applicant is applying for international protection only to delay or impede the implementation of the return decision are not laid down in the law. The Court therefore concludes that there is no legal basis for the imposition of a movement restriction measure under Article 84 § 84 (3), first indent, of the MLM-1 in the present case either. <15. Since the Court of First Instance considers that, in the present case, there is therefore no ground for restriction of movement under the third indent of Article 84(1) of the ZMZ-1, the Court of First Instance annuls the contested decision on the basis of Article 64(1)(4) of the Causes of Action Act. Since the Court annulled the order on the ground that it had erred in the application of substantive law, it did not rule on all the other pleas relied on by the applicant in the application. <p/> 16. Article 84(6) of the CTMO-1 provides that the court shall, after hearing the applicant orally beforehand, decide on the applicant's application within three working days. It is clear from the draft ZMZ-11 that the hearing is to be held on the grounds of a substantial interference with the applicant's liberty, i.e. in his favour. However, in the present case, where there is no adequate basis for the measure of restriction of movement under Article 84(3), first paragraph, first indent, of the ZMZ-1, a hearing of the applicant would even achieve the opposite purpose. The holding of a main hearing would therefore be an end in itself; at the same time, the principle of the economy of proceedings would be infringed, since the court would have to ensure the applicant's presence, provide him with an interpreter and represent him by proxy in order to hear him, thereby incurring unnecessary procedural costs. Nor was the defendant's right to be heard thereby infringed, since he was served with the application, to which he replied. <p/> On point II of the operative part of the judgment: <p/> 17. The Court dismissed the application for interim measures, applying mutatis mutandis Article 36(1)(6) Causa-1, on the ground that, in the light of the decision on the application for interim measures, the applicant had no legal interest in the interim proceedings. In accordance with Article 73(1) of the Causes of Civil Procedure Act, no appeal is allowed against that judgment and, since no appeal is possible, the court's judgment (point I of the operative part of the operative part of the judgment) means that the court has given a final decision on the matter, and the applicant therefore no longer has a legal interest in the interim injunction, which is time-bound until the final decision. The final judgment of that judgment in itself terminates the restriction of movement, since the order for restriction of movement has been lifted.

__label__objective Sports hall completed <p/> After twenty-five years of work, a new multi-purpose sports hall has been completed in Mengeš, which will be used by schoolchildren in the morning and by associations and other citizens in the afternoon and evening. It will be handed over on 1 October. <p/> The hall cost €4.5 million and Mengeš also obtained a grant for the investment. <p/> Mengeš - The multi-purpose sports hall, located next to the Mengeš Primary School, is almost complete after a year since the foundation stone was laid last June. These days, workers are sanding and varnishing the parquet flooring, while minor landscaping work is being carried out on the external areas. <p/> According to the Director of the Mengeš Municipal Administration, Urban Kolar, a technical inspection will be carried out on Thursday and the hall will be handed over on 1 October. <p/> The hall, together with the outdoor playgrounds and the athletics track with tartan and climbing wall inside, will primarily be used for sports lessons and other leisure activities of the Mengeš Primary School, but other local associations and citizens will also be able to use the hall in the afternoons and evenings. "I don't think it is a question of whether it will be occupied or not. There is also a lot of interest from associations and individuals from the surrounding municipalities. I think we could easily fill the dates, even if we had another hall," says Kolar, who is particularly pleased that the municipal administration has managed to carry out such a large investment without taking out a loan, thanks to the grants they have received. The EcoFund contributed 845 thousand euros for the low-energy facility, five hundred thousand were obtained from the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport, and a further 65 thousand from the Foundation for Sport.The EcoFund has also contributed 845 thousand euros for the low-energy facility. The contract value of the hall is €4.5 million, it was built by Graditelj from Kamnik, with whom Mengeš was very satisfied, and the interior fittings, worth €660 thousand, are being installed by Elan Inventa. <p/> The construction of the new sports hall will free up the current gym of the primary school, which is to be converted into a kitchen and dining room, as well as four additional classrooms. "With almost nine hundred pupils, Mengeška Primary School is one of the largest in Slovenia. The municipality has already solved the space problem in the past by building extensions, first to the west, then to the east, and now the third phase, the reconstruction of the school gym, is on the cards," says Kolar, who adds that the procedures have already started, but it is too early to talk about the amount of the investment, as they need to get the designers' estimates first. The municipality will certainly have to take out a loan for the investment. <p/> The redevelopment of the gymnasium is therefore the final stage in solving the school's space problem, which will ensure that Mengeš has enough classroom capacity for the next few years. However, given that the immigration trend in the municipality is quite high and the population could easily grow from the current 8200 to tens of thousands or more in the next few years, any future space needs of the school will have to be solved by setting up a new primary school or a branch, Kolar believes.
__label__subjective Posts tagged 'incinerator' <p/> In the autumn 2010 issue of Dupličan, Bogdan Pogačar published the following article, which we reproduce in full: <p/> A directive of the European Union required Member States to issue new permits, or to re-examine and, if necessary, renew existing permits, for all industrial installations that started operating before 30 October 1999 by 30 October 2007. <p/> Slovenia is one of only six countries not to comply with the EU's Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive, and will have to defend itself before the European Court of Justice. It faces a fine of €80 million, which the country will have to pay over the next four years. Given that the inhabitants of the southern part of the municipality of Kamnik (Perovo, Bakovnik, Šmarca, Volčji Potok, Duplica) regularly have legitimate concerns about the quality of the air they breathe, which is part of their everyday lives, such indifference on the part of the State is incomprehensible to me. The fact is that we live in a densely populated area and in close proximity to industrial plants that pollute the air with emissions from their activities. Of course, these are companies that have been operating here for many years and cannot be relocated elsewhere, but everything must be done to reduce emissions into the air. It is not just about the health of the most vulnerable groups, such as children and the elderly, but also about reducing the value of movable and immovable property in the area. <p/> The most painful thorn in our side is the 'environmentally unfriendly' operation of the Tisa Ltd. wood biomass heating plant, which has been preventing us from enjoying a good quality of life for 13 years.

But for once, Mafia is better for me. <p/> yes, in mafia it's a pain in the ass when you shoot a thomson for half an hour to kill a mafioso with a shkifarska and then shoot three times to kill him!!! cars go like tractors but it's true that mafia has the advantage that you can learn how to steal cars first!!! and when you walk by a bayti you'll see that everything is a bit strange but when it comes to GTA you can copy bayti!!!not to mention the fact that you drive a car in a skiff, and when you're not in the car, the skiff can see exactly how much you're driving when they had radar even back then!!! and you don't even have to get on a boat, but you still drive around!!! if I had more time, I'd be happy to discuss what mistakes there are in the mafia, and besides, GTA isn't without its faults!!!!!! so that you don't think that I'm defending GTA when you're at the beginning of the game and when you're on the phone, the phone is huge and when you're on the phone, you can also k**** into cars after having sex, and you can k**** it !!! so I like GTA better!!! maybe mafia 2 will be better than GTA and probably it will be!!! but when there will be a new GTA, it seems to me that mafia will be a lot of slapstick!!!!!!! we'll see!!!GTA IS THE LAW <p/> yeah you forget that sometimes the cars were really so slow and after the end you get better and very fast cars if you turn mafia 100% you get one car called crazy horse and it's impossible to drive because it's fast... besides you can put it on the back tyres... CRAZY <p/> yes angel you are right,if you turn around the game itself and the Lucas Bertone quests and Free Ride Extreme the game is even more interesting <p/> gee I can't stand to see your pointless posts comparing mafia to vice city. you can't compare two spiels like that in graphics and gameplay. you can't compare two spiels like that in graphics and gameplay. each has its own story and each takes place in a different time, which also explains the cars and their speeds. bOy; no spiel is without its faults, and mafia is also an older spiel, about 1 year old, so please. not with such meaningless comments!!!! <p/> didn't you even read it or did you lose your glasses???? i wrote that in GTA their phone is huge so before you write anything you can even read it!!!!and i didn't say that GTA is bug free but we are at the end of 2003 not 2222!!!!

Pistorius does not deny killing his girlfriend, but claims it was an accident and that he mistook her for a burglar. <p/> Pistorius is a six-time Paralympic gold medallist and a participant in the 2012 London Olympics in athletics. Pistorius was free to await trial after posting bail of €74,000.
__label__objective JEDRO: The sum of two insurance benefits from two insurance contracts cannot be taken into account because each of the insurance contracts constitutes an independent factual and legal basis for the dispute. As none of the amounts claimed exceeds the audit threshold, no audit is admissible. <p/> CONCLUSION: The revision is dismissed. <p/> REFERENCE: The applicant claimed payment of insurance benefits under two insurance contracts. He claimed payment of SIT 700 000 under the supplementary accident insurance, taken out at the same time as the compulsory motor insurance, and SIT 955 603 under the collective accident insurance. Thus, by his primary claim, he claimed payment of SIT 1 655 603, and by his subordinate claim he claimed payment of SIT 700 000 under the first contract and EUR 5 356 under the second contract, in which the sum insured was denominated in DEM. The Court of First Instance ruled that the defendant must pay the plaintiff SIT 170 000, dismissed the primary claim in excess and further ruled on the costs of the proceedings. The Court of Second Instance allowed the applicant's appeal only in part by modifying the costs order, but otherwise dismissed it and upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance. <p/> The review was delivered to the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Slovenia and served on the defendant, who did not reply. <p/> The review is not allowed. <p/> According to Article 367(2) of the Civil Procedure Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 73/2007 ZPP - UPB3), a review is admissible in property disputes if the value of the contested part of the second instance judgment exceeds the amount of EUR 4,172.926 (formerly SIT 1,000,000). The applicant has indicated an amount of SIT 1,485,603 (now EUR 6,199.31) as the review value of the dispute, but such a definition is not correct for the purpose of determining the review value of the dispute. It is the sum of two amounts which he was unsuccessful in the litigation: the rejected amount of SIT 530 000 (now EUR 2 211,65) in respect of the first insurance contract which he himself had concluded and the total rejected amount of SIT 955 603 (now EUR 3 987,66) in respect of the collective accident insurance. The sum cannot be taken into account because each insurance contract is independent, concluded at different times and with different content, and therefore the contracts also constitute different factual and legal bases for the dispute. Since the condition laid down in Article 41(1) of the CCP in conjunction with Article 39 of the CCP for aggregating the amounts in dispute is not met, the value of each individual claim must be taken into account under the second paragraph of the same Article. <p/> None of the amounts mentioned exceeds the audit threshold. Therefore, pursuant to Article 377 of the CPC, the Court of Appeal decided on the applicant's unauthorised revision as set out in the operative part of the present decision, which also includes a decision on the applicant's claimed revision costs.
__label__subjective Advent is a time of anticipation. Preparations for this year's Christmas are upon us. Preparation requires a certain amount of cooperation and commitment on our part. We do not wait with our arms crossed. Only children behave like that, not knowing what to do and therefore bored. If I personally want to prepare for the holiday and also get the most out of the holiday, then I have to make a programme of what I want to achieve and then work hard to really achieve the goals I have set. I will not dwell on those for whom Christmas is just a nice family holiday, when they are at home more, when they are doing the gift-giving, when they are perhaps having a Christmas holiday together on the white slopes, but we will not see them in church for the holidays because they have no faith, or because they think they have done enough by putting up a Christmas tree and an artistic nativity scene at home. I will leave aside those things that have no connection with the Christian faith and instead dwell on the Slovenian traditional Christmas celebration. What goals can I set myself in preparation for Christmas? For some, Christmas will be a time to reminisce about old times, to think about childhood and time with parents and family traditions. So they will put up the nativity scene and the Christmas tree, bless the premises in the old way, say a prayer and have a good dinner. At midnight, they will probably attend a midnight feast. It will be a really nice revival of an old tradition, and many will enjoy it. With this revival of old customs and traditions, the question that comes to my mind is: What benefit will this bring me? To what extent will these old traditions change and transform me? What will this new preparation for Christmas bring me that will make my everyday life different, richer, calmer and more meaningful? The beautiful old traditions are certainly necessary because they speak of our historical memory, which is necessary and we should not be ashamed of. Beautiful traditions are the wealth of a nation, and it is right to preserve and revive them. However, it seems to me that this will not bring into my daily life the new things that will challenge me, because they will offer me new content, because they will require me to bring into the Advent preparation for Christmas the novelties that are part of me, linked to my thinking and feeling. In this way, Christmas will no longer be just a nice old folklore, but will have a touch of the contemporary, of my personal life. Analysts have noted that man, especially Western man, and thus also Slovenian man, is increasingly losing his soul because he has allowed himself to be so drawn in by materialism that he can no longer shake it off. Materialism is like a terrible anaconda, a serpent that wraps itself around its victim and squeezes him so that he can no longer escape from its embrace. This squeezing of the serpent gets worse and worse by the moment, as it breaks the victim's bones, and in the end she suffocates, all numb. To live a more free life worthy of man, it is necessary to get out of this embrace and to put a limit to materialism. We must realise that money must not be our master, but on the contrary, we must be its master, we must put a limit to consumerism. Advent preparation for Christmas therefore consists first of all in making a careful analysis of my ordinary life. I must see clearly and evaluate my desires and expectations, but I must also be aware of my limits and my delusions. Both need to be put on the scales and to see which way the scales tip: if there are too many negative things, action needs to be taken immediately. Any delay will only lead to a growing alienation from oneself, from one's neighbours and from God. Any persistence in negative things leads to more and more dependence. At a certain point, you have to tell yourself that the time has come to get rid of all that weighs you down, takes away your freedom and harms you. It is necessary to remove all these things and say loud and clear to yourself: 'Why should I harm myself! I don't want to see this anymore! "The strong will that is awakened by this then needs to be strengthened more every day. It is necessary to reckon with God, it is necessary to reckon with the power of prayer, and above all it is necessary to deepen faith. Only he who believes in God is then able to throw himself into God's arms, to confess his guilt and sins and to forgive first himself and then his neighbour. This is the only way we can purify ourselves and free ourselves from the past that presses us to the ground and does not let us breathe freely. We must first forgive ourselves, gain respect and trust, so that we can then forgive our neighbours and finally be reconciled to God. This is the only way to breathe more freely. Any search for any other means that does not take into account man's guilt and purify it with God's forgiveness and mercy is doomed to failure. So let us not fall for the various Internet offers that promise a quick solution. This is just a waste of money without any real effect. Why not rather cling to God, who demands no payment for Himself. His love is free, everything we receive from Him is free. Why not make the most of the opportunity that is given to us. Why not make something beautiful out of our lives that we will always be proud of and others will be richer for our change. Above all, we must remember what the prophet Jeremiah told us in the first verse: "The days will come when I will keep my promise! "For God keeps His covenant: what He promises, He keeps. Perhaps we do not see this in our own lives because we have not yet allowed God to come in and put our lives in order. Perhaps we have relied too much on ourselves and our own abilities, and so we do not recognise the miracles that are happening today. Perhaps we have been so tempted by money that we have bet everything on this one ticket, and so we are constantly afraid and trembling about what will happen to our savings, which have been severely depleted by the recession. Yes, we need to get rid of this fear and build our confidence on new foundations that are not destroyed by the moth. So today we set out on the road to prepare for Christmas this year. May this holiday truly be a challenge to everyone to make this Christmas different. Christ came as our Saviour to be reborn, so that we might become new people. So now is the chance for each of us to make that happen. There is no exception. For me, too, this feast is a challenge, even though things may be clearer to me in theory. Theory is not life. That is why the preparation and the celebration itself must leave an impact on our emotional sphere, on our attitude to life and to everything that surrounds us. When this happens, we will indeed look at Christmas very differently. It is certainly true that Christmas is the most romantic of all the Church festivals, but it must also bring new content to our lives. Let us therefore enter boldly into the Advent season and use it for our personal renewal and the renewal of our parish community. <p/> Contact us <p/> Spiritual reflection

__label__objective Description. We presented the public goods game, its rules, strategies and possible payoffs. We have presented the three main elementary strategies for playing the public goods game. These are co-operation, co-operation with reward and co-operation with punishment. In order to make the results comparable throughout the paper, we have tried to choose parameters where we can compare the results directly or at least within some reasonable similarity. The presentations of the elementary strategies showed that they contribute to fostering the development of cooperation and that punishment is the most successful of the presented ones, because it fosters cooperation even at lower synergy factors. The presentation of the elementary strategies is followed by a test of whether there are any evolutionary advantages in combining correlated positive and negative reciprocity into a single strategy. Similarly to the presentation of the elementary strategies, we have also looked at the strategy of simultaneous reward and punishment and obtained results showing that, independently of the synergy factor at which the simulations were run, the combined strategy of punishment and reward did not show evolutionary advantages over the elementary strategies of reward and, in particular, punishment. While narrow bands have been shown for very unrealistic parameters where the combined strategy can show its strength, it also appears that punishment alone would be superior for the same parameters.

__label__subjective Heh, but this kind of statement baffles me... are these compartmentalising people consistent? So dogs are supposed to be lonely according to them. What about for the fish? What about cats? Or chinchillas? What about birds, turtles, horses, etc.? Gosh, I find this really funny. I'll tell you. For all the animals, there are people who know how to see the joy in any daddy. <p/> A puppy is <p/>really such a sweet companion who gets you out and about - whether you're lonely or there are too many Kittens around, you just like to go to peace for a bit. And another thing - there really is something in his eyes that you rarely find in human eyes - loyalty without selfishness, M. <p/> Well, to be fair <p/> (and not in the style of I. Gartner! ), then it has to be said that a lot of people have a dog because they ARE lonely. AND very lonely! There are too many people who are canine asocials and would rather have a dog than a human companion. There are far too many (let's say) grandmothers who don't watch their grandchildren because the children make their pet...um...nervous.....There are far too many people who prefer dogs to children.... There have been heated debates about this on some forums this year.... <p/> In short... THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE who have lost touch with reality and give a dog the love they are incapable of giving to their fellow man. <p/> But that doesn't mean that we are not normal in between.... <p/> Those of us who love dogs, but at the same time know that a dog - however we turn it - is still " just " an animal. .... . <p/> MM <p/> Untitled comment <p/> I knew someone who was always greeted happily by a puppy when he came home from work. he said, a little jokingly, that the puppy always made him happy, but his wife never once greeted him so happily at the door, greeting him, d <p/> auntie:) <p/> I disagree. if there's anything a single man is already missing - it's a partner. i.e. a man. but somehow I persist in believing that he's not looking for a dog, heh. because a dog can't replace a man. it can only bring him more life and depth. and that's got nothing to do with this situation. <p/> you want a dog if you like it as a creature. that's how it is when you are a child and when you grow up. the feeling of loneliness is born in the person, not in the surroundings. even married people have it sometimes. <p/> but if some unfortunate soul takes it (the dog) for that reason... the uiber has brought himself around, heh. because in that case the dog is just a means to keep himself so busy that he 'forgets' his feelings. a workaholic would then work more. gulp. self-curation and problem-solving I call it. <p/> for me, the dog has never been a means of making contact. i do just fine without it. <p/> giggles, clots:) <p/> I don't really bother about what is found in a dog and what is found in a person. both are fine with me. the dog comes to me, I like it and therefore I accept the whole package it brings. <p/> for me <p/> animals are part of life, they belong to human life, just like other people do. But it is true that it can be much more tiring to coexist with people than with animals. A human being is a bit half degenerated in our time here and now...., (puneguzitsevsegapachserjessepovsodane... ) and his psyche is fucking him up, of course, the cockroach yes... so it's really healing to socialize with animals <p/> hm, milena:) <p/> to be fair, I assume that many people have said so themselves. what I think about this, I already said in my reply to my aunt... come on, please read it, so I don't write it again. <p/> but if you feel that way about it, from your reasoning... i guess i don't need to point out that it is a labelling and / or she-said-she-said system. so far from real and fair for me. <p/> i have said many times before that i find it disingenuous to devote exclusively to animals or exclusively to humans (and not really in this post yet). and i find the not saving grandmothers with grandchildren you mention from this very title sick (and vice versa as well). it's just that you have to take the time to educate the children about the dog (some are really total antitalents) and the dog about the children. i think it's a good idea to take the time to educate the children about the dog (one is really a total antitalent) and the dog about the children. i think it's a good idea to educate the children about the dog. <p/>people who prefer dogs to children and people who prefer dogs to people are in the same basket. the difference is only in age, but it's the same. <p/> otherwise, this post is about the fact that being a dog guardian is not even close to being lonely after defolt. <p/> I love dogs. I love people. and any way you turn it - man is also ' just ' an animal. if mankind, in its self-importance, discarded all other living beings, it would breathe nothing and could only eat itself. the funny thing is that sometimes it does it without doing that. <p/> giggles, darja:) <p/> but I don't take them literally as a rule (somehow it makes sense to me that there was probably a period of falling in love, hihi). it is true, though, that we humans have this poison in us called self-importance. and then the dog's ability to be happy every time is quite charming. <p/> and you know, I didn't usually meet any guy at the door either, hehehehe... because I don't hear or smell as well as a dog. <p/> duck:) <p/> but the point this time is quite different. the point is that we should respect humans too. um. well, it's really intertwined, yes. if you respect both the animal and the human, then a respectful attitude towards the coexistence of animals and humans is quite automatic. <p/> just this one <p/> we have it too and I can't imagine not having it because it has brought such joy to everybody that it's hard to say. <p/> What I find interesting is a statement my child once made when we asked him how it is that he treats kittens and puppies differently from people, shows them all the love, in short, treats them differently from the way he used to treat people.His answer was ANIMALS HAVE NEVER NEEDED MAN BUT MORE THAN ONCE AGAIN. <p/> Hey Mermaid <p/> Yes, animals are part of life and being with man. Whether they live with you or with a neighbour. In my life I have had the opportunity to observe completely different cultures in relation to fish. Let's say in Greece. The dog strictly belongs out of the house. It is not allowed to sit on the sofa or armchair. Or bring hair and germs from outside to inside. They don't even let it near a small child. And if by chance a little furry thing wandered into the playground, the mums would scream and shout. And if the unfortunate creature had the misfortune to make a lot of noise (especially in the cities), it wasn't too hard for the neighbours to poison the dog (we had a kitten in Athens once, and I don't even know what it did to them). <p/> On the other hand, I observe the English. They are very nice to animals (well, there are extreme exceptions, but I'm speaking generally). In the army and police, dogs get decorations and titles (Sargeant, Lutenant, etc.), and there is not a house in the countryside that doesn't have two dogs. When I asked "my" family why they all have two dogs, they said: "So that the fish don't get lonely... all the time, we are not and can't be with them all the time, so it's nice not to have just one animal but to have a family! "So it's not that humans need company, but that the dog also needs company. I also meet people from other cultures who find fish "unclean". Yes, there are different views. Only those who really know how important fish are respect them. And now, in England, they are considering reintroducing the brown bear and the wolf, which are also native here, but have historically been exterminated. I am very interested to see how this debate ends. <p/> Grandma:) <p/> hmm... i wouldn't talk about how many of them and why they prefer a dog to a child... because i don't know any of them and i don't have one. when i try to empathise... the thing that jumps out at me the most is that it's easier to protect a dog. if you don't trust the world, the upbringing and the influences of others... it's easier to be responsible for a puppy. because you can separate it from the upbringing of a stranger. but anyway, i insist that it's not ok to turn away from people. <p/> I don't like this kind of labelling in general. i know couples who had a dog for a long time but not a child. now they have a child too. and i find it ugly and unnecessary to just compartmentalise. there is no rule what you have to have first. <p/> and I honestly don't see why anyone should be obliged to coach football instead of volleyball, or have 2 children instead of one, or go into parenthood if they don't want to (or as long as they don't want to). to please others? Why? let them live their own ideas and performances... <p/> and why should someone who doesn't want to have children - and a dog - be worse than someone who doesn't want either a child or a dog? but someone who doesn't want to have children and has fish is immaculate in everyone's eyes, or what? <p/> if someone wants to have children, let them have them, yes, in these cases it is the motives that matter. if they don't want to have children, they don't. let others have that freedom of choice, and let us stick to our own. it is a great disservice to the child to impose social pressure on the child. <p/> zuzi:) <p/> hi, it's true that they are part of life. but when it comes to living and being a neighbour, it's both direct and indirect. it's all part of life, but there are significant differences. <p/> let's say. i have a ricky. i chose to live with him, not with all the dogs of all the neighbours. the neighbours don't bother me (even when they are loud, no), but they are not so directly part of my life that i would want to pee their poo out of my garden. luckily the neighbours are so correct that it's clear to them, heh. <p/> and there are differences in societies, yes... for me, the english version is the closest. i find it very real this respect for all beings, to see not only through oneself, but also to them, for them.

__label__objective German is a three-year subject in primary school, taught for two hours a week. It is aimed at pupils in Year 8 who have the joy and the will to learn a foreign language. <p/> Knowledge of a foreign language is important because it is of direct use to the pupils (e.g. watching German television, listening to music, communicating with foreign friends and German-speaking relatives, reading instructions, etc.), and it is also a good starting point for further education and careers. <p/> In German lessons, students will be able to: <p/> communicate in basic German, <p/> make contacts and handle situations more easily, and <p/> acquire knowledge about German countries, their people and culture. <p/> German 2 <p/> is designed as a continuation and build-up of German 1. The level of difficulty increases gradually, while still dealing with topics that are close to the students' heart. <p/> They learn: <p/> to order food in a restaurant, <p/> to describe their daily life, <p/> to list different sports, <p/> to describe the weather and holidays, <p/> to write a birthday greeting, <p/> to learn about the human body and act out a situation at the doctor's office, <p/> they also encounter the past tense. <p/> The course will be taught by Jasmina Kene, Prof. German. <p/> OPTIONAL SUBJECT: EXPERIMENTS IN CHEMISTRY <p/> The elective subject is grade-specific.

It can be taken in grade 8. <p/> The course lasts one school year. <p/> It consists of 35 hours per year or 1 hour per week. <p/> The subject: <p/> - extends the basic knowledge of natural-geographical and socio-geographical phenomena and processes in the world, <p/> The compulsory elective subject Religions and Ethics is derived from the social sciences and offers pupils the opportunity to extend/complement the knowledge of religions and ethics acquired by all pupils in the compulsory subjects (History, Slovene, Ethics and Social Studies).<p/> The compulsory elective subject Religions and Ethics is derived from the social sciences. <p/> The subject Religions and Ethics is a three-year course and can therefore be taken in Years 7, 8 and 9 of Year 9 for one lesson per week. The curriculum and its implementation allow pupils to choose the subject in a meaningful way for one or two years, even if its purpose is more fully realised only in a three-year course. In this case, pupils attend the lessons scheduled for their class. This is achieved by adhering to the basic principles: <p/> 1) that religious subjects are dealt with in three units <p/> 2) that in the way religious issues are dealt with, an approach appropriate to the age level of the pupils is given prominence <p/> 3) that ethical and life issues are chosen in the light of the pupils' inclinations and needs.
__label__subjective The best bikini of this year's holiday <p/> Summer is well into its last third and is inexorably saying goodbye. The September part is traditionally dominated by pensioners, who certainly have different appetites and tastes to us younger ones. The seaside ambience is much more eye-opening than usual during the year, as things come into view that you don't notice during the year. <p/> One of those is surely all the various rags that cover where the sun rarely sets... At least for most? <p/> And it's these cloths, which nowadays are even given names defined by their stylish appearance, no longer just swimwear (boxers, bikinis ... ), that give a unique look to the body. <p/> Indeed, how the look can depend on this mini garment. As swimwear is a science of its own for women, I can say, through male eyes, that this bikini, pictured here, brightened up my holiday look and is particularly memorable among all the ones I have seen. In short, it was the best swimsuit of my summer this year. I'm sure it was also influenced by the content, which certainly means one thing and brings it to a flattering conclusion.

__label__subjective For your consideration... <p/> I belong to that school of modern observers who believe that the world is at a turning point. In the course of history we have repeatedly lost confidence in eternal truths. Among them, in religion, in the State and in the world being flat. Today, we are giving up this trust to the market as we knew it until recently. The most radical language of new values and demands for a reorganisation of the system is spoken today by civil society initiatives. They do not see the existing model of market capitalism as the solution for a sustainable and just society. A new language is also being spoken by a growing part of the economy, which is adapting its business models, attitudes and value creation processes to values and co-creating them in dialogue with the needs of the people. Social and economic value creation processes are being reinvented, based on self-organisation, commodity exchange, participatory and democratic forms of ownership. The present is beginning to speak a language that holds the promise of radical change for the better. <p/> Not many people speak this language, but they are increasingly being heard. Because we all want to believe that something better is possible. Because we need to believe that better can always be (more) possible. <p/> We all understand part of this language. Some say it is useless, that it is outdated. Others believe that it can only partially explain and justify the needs of modern society. Still others add new slogans to enrich it and throw out concepts that do not belong. We seem to be reassembling the alphabet of the world. And, given the current indicators of the overall balance sheet, this is more than necessary. What this alphabet will bring will be determined by the concrete actions and changes that this new language will trigger. We can still hope that we are living in times of change. <p/> As we write this first blog entry, it is also our first text entry dedicated to the online community that has started to coalesce in recent months around the people who co-create the Vive mission [ 1 ]. In the period behind us, this community has taken small but courageous steps towards the goal of a better life that defines us as a collective, as collaborators, as colleagues, as friends, as a community. While we are aware that we could not have set ourselves a broader goal than a better life, we are slowly realising that this goal has very clear trajectories. <p/> In the process of defining our values, fleshing out our goals and strategising our work plan, we have continually stumbled over the breadth of the notion of a better life. What values bind us together as a community of colleagues? Which values are those that represent our minimum common denominator? How do we offer something truly new, something that is our product, in a crowd of organisations, ideas and activities that all promise us a better life? <p/> If, after this paragraph, you think that we have found all the answers, we must disappoint you. We haven't. Not all of them, anyway. But we are learning, every day, that there is incredible potential in our neighbourhood, from individuals with extraordinary ideas and innovative skills. That many organisations, initiatives and companies are making an invaluable contribution to the quality of life for all of us. These are all those who are working in different ways to create a world based on a just economy, who are breathing for us to eat better, healthier and fairer food, who believe that we have the right to a better democracy and for whom health is a right, not just an individual responsibility.

The work was carried out from 19 June to 15 July 2006 as part of the compulsory field course for archaeology students. <p/> The house, known as Vodiškar's House, stands on the edge of the terrace of the Nevljica stream. The oldest part of the building, the house, is built of wooden logs and is dendrochronologically dated to between 1580 and 1600. The wooden structure is set on a stone cellar, which is dug into the bank. In the 18th or 19th century, a stone vestibule with a black kitchen and a room or stiblc was added to the east of the house. The whole, now three-part building was then plastered. The building was covered with a thatched roof, which was removed in the 1970s. Due to the poor load-bearing capacity of the walls, the new roof was supported on free-standing concrete piers on the north and west sides. <p/> In 2004, as part of the planned renovation of the outside of the building, the owners machine-excavated drainage ditches along the walls and removed the plaster on the wooden part of the building. A larger, irregularly shaped construction pit was dug along the west façade of the building, which extended below the level of the basement foundations. One or more cultural layers were removed, which contained a large number of pottery fragments dating from the High Middle Ages, animal bones and charcoal. However, large quantities of modern pottery, glass shards and metal objects were found throughout. <p/> Archaeological excavations were then carried out prior to the resumption of construction works, but were limited to a few selected small areas due to the previous destruction of the stratification and for static reasons. <p/> The southern part of the stile was partially excavated, where the owners had already removed the weathered wooden floorboards before the excavations began. Under two layers of fill with finds from the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries, we found a light brown screed of sand, soil and lime up to 6 cm thick. It showed clear signs of wear and was smeared with mud and soot from the Black Kitchen. It was laid directly on the sterile subsoil of the site, which consists of thick gravel and sand deposits. The foundations of the stone walls of the shingle were shallowly dug into it, only about 10 cm deep. Small finds suggest that the hill was built over in the 18th or early 19th century. A test excavation in the courtyard along the eastern wall of the fortress showed that the courtyard had been flattened when the fortress was built, thus completely destroying the older stratification. <p/> The area in front of the wooden door along the north wall of the house, the presumed original entrance to the building, was also investigated. The strip between the wall of the house and the roof struts was filled in and partially levelled with thick stones, sand, building materials and household waste when the new roof structure was built in the 1970s. Below were some earth layers associated with the construction of the extension with the black kitchen and the tiled stove. The foundation of the stone wall behind the pottery oven was dug 50 cm deep through the thick rubble of an 80 cm wide dry wall, which ran parallel to the northern wall of the cellar or house at a distance of 1.40 m. The wall may have formed the foundation of an enclosed extension next to the house or may have merely served as a truss to consolidate and level the walking surface in front of the former entrance to the building. To the north of the wall, we documented two wooden uprights, possibly supporting the pitched roof, the existence of which is evidenced by three cut-outs for the supporting beams in the north wall of the house. The excavated wall and the stone wall of the cellar were dug into the sterile base of the site. To the north of the drystone wall, several successive earth deposits with numerous modern finds were excavated. In the westernmost part of the excavation site we documented several layers overlying the bank here, containing fragments of High Medieval pottery. <p/> The large machine excavation in front of the cellar entrance on the west side of the building was only cleaned and levelled due to the static threat to the west wall of the cellar. In the western profile, we documented, among other things, three layers with High Medieval finds. The pottery is virtually identical to the finds from the older phase of the castle at Malé grad in nearby Kamnik and can be tentatively dated to the 11th or 12th century, the time when the village of Nevlje, next to the old parish church, began to develop.

__label__subjective Ordinary Woman (Written by Danaja Lorenčič) <p/> In the eyes of ten year old, twenty year old and even thirty year old Danaja, I was burned at the stake in my quest to become something special. <p/> Danaja Lorenčič <p/> A few weeks ago, I was invited for coffee by a friend I rarely see. But while talking to her, I immediately got that familiar feeling that reminds me again and again why I love some people so much. Because they don't hide behind a mask of perfection, they don't feel ashamed of their vulnerability, they don't get defensive when they are in need, and they don't resort to cynicism when you touch their wounds during a conversation. <p/> Before we had each had our cup of coffee, she told me that she had been searching for her own identity lately, as she had lost herself in the last few years due to her many roles. She was starting to wonder who she was if she wasn't a mother and a wife who went to work and in her spare time was a musician. It touched me when she confessed that one of her greatest fears was to become an ordinary woman, so she kept up her hobbies, even when she no longer enjoyed them, because she was afraid that without them she would slip into a boring routine and turn into an uninteresting person. How I recognised myself in her words! I don't have any hobbies, because I have turned what I enjoy most into my work (i.e. writing), but I identified with her fear of the ordinary. Suddenly, hundreds of scenes swirled in my head, reminding me of all I had done to escape the image of the ordinary woman I feared almost as much as my own death. <p/> To avoid becoming ordinary, I kept my weight low and for a short time even believed that anorexia made me special. To avoid becoming ordinary, I rejected the idea of a serious relationship for years because I thought that being single was something that only independent, strong women could do. To avoid becoming ordinary, I dreamt for a very, very long time of a singing career that would save me from an ordinary life, paying bills and annoying bosses. To avoid becoming ordinary, I hung out with damaged people who, like me, refused to grow up for a long time. To avoid becoming ordinary, I gave up my first and only regular job. To avoid becoming ordinary, I gave up any thought of motherhood by the age of thirty-five. <p/> Of all the things I did to escape from ordinariness, there is only one thing I do not regret - that I gave up a job that did not make me the least bit happy. Which is not to say that I was entirely happy about it afterwards, as I swallowed the bitter experience of precarious work. But I took responsibility for that decision and faced it. Because by giving up a secure job, I was not running away from discomfort, I was throwing myself out of my comfort zone and starting to develop my potential within my discomfort zone. <p/> This made me feel special, and I tried to escape the fate of the ordinary woman in other areas of my life. I decided that I wanted to write for a living and convinced myself that this was only possible if I didn't have a partner to start a family with, as this would certainly hinder me from achieving my goals. I was operating under the mindset: If I want to be special, I have to give up what is typical of most people. <p/> In reality, I was scared of love after the love wrecks that had caused me emotional wounds. I was scared to let go of control of my weight because I thought I would lose control of my life. I was afraid to end destructive relationships with people who hated themselves because I was afraid they would hate me too. And I was terrified of becoming a mother - especially if I gave birth to a baby girl, because I knew that I would be a bad role model for her because of my unprocessed pain, my denial of pleasure, my tendency to abuse myself and to repress my emotions. <p/> If I take a closer look at my life, which is something of a ritual for me this week as I celebrate my 38th birthday, it is certainly different and in some ways much less special than I imagined it would be. <p/> For me, being special meant creating a life that did not involve complicated emotions, arguments, sharing household responsibilities with a partner and parenthood. <p/> Hearing my friend say that she was afraid of being ordinary made me think about how I had misinterpreted specialness and at the same time had an unjustified fear of being ordinary. Because back then, when I was striving for specialness, I was nowhere near as content and at peace as I am now. <p/> If I take a closer look at my life, which for me is a kind of obligatory ritual this week as I celebrate my 38th birthday, it is certainly different and in some ways much less special than I imagined it would be. I am no longer obsessed with controlling my weight. I have not become a famous singer or a successful writer. I have not stayed single so that I can create uninterrupted. I do not have many friends, because I have distanced myself from those who used to burden me with their darkness. And I did not give up motherhood so that I did not have to change anything about myself that I was not proud of. <p/> In the eyes of ten-year-old, twenty-year-old and even thirty-year-old Danaja, I was burnt out in my efforts to become something special. But in the eyes of Danaja, who is slowly approaching forty, I see peace. <p/> And that is what I have longed for for years. For an inner peace that I have wrongly called an ordinary life.
__label__subjective Kurtic finally takes Allegri away <p/> Ljubljana - Massimiliano Allegri paid dearly for Milan's painful defeat against Sassuolo, for whom Slovenian international Jasmin Kurtic also plays. The former Perugia coach was left without a job the day after the defeat. <p/> Massimiliano Allegri announced some time ago that he would retire from the Milan bench at the end of the season. The 3:4 defeat against Sassuolo, after the rossoneri had already led 2:0, meant that his story on the bench of the seven-time European champions had already ended a few months earlier. Domenico Berardi, 19, was fatal for Milan and Allegri, taking Sassuolo fans to heaven even after two passes from Jasmin Kurtic, while Milan supporters wondered how low their favourites could go. <p/> After the new defeat, the red-and-blacks remain in 11th place, just six points above the places leading to the second league and a whopping 30 points behind leaders Juventus. Milan have not been this low for a long time. Who can lead it out of the abyss? For some time now, Clarence Seedorf, who is contracted to Botafogo, has been mentioned as the most serious successor to Allegri, and Filippo Inzaghi, who is gaining his first coaching experience in Milan's youth team, is also among the very serious candidates. Allegri's legacy Milan have played far below the expectations of the fans this season under Allegri's leadership. But the question is who could get more out of Milan's current squad. Valter Birsa, on whom Allegri has shown great confidence, has also scored for the two Serie A victories. Otherwise, Allegri had a mediocre squad, which would have had a hard time in the fight for the top spots. <p/> Allegri came to the world's fashion capital in 2010 and won the title right away. He finished second and third in the next two years, but after selling Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva, the chariot went sharply downhill.

He's been offered a slice of classic Australian literature to digest, from the pen of David Malouf, the multi-award-winning kangaroo, fiction writer, poet and novelist. The novel in question, An Imaginary Life, is one of the so-called postcolonial reads... <p/> To a random chimp like myself, it is easy to believe that the human imagination knows no bounds. Imagine, then, whose skin you would jump into, where you would fly to, if your thoughts did not keep crashing into the walls of reality. It would be nice to be a chicken in a world without a poultry industry, or a mediocre chair, immune to the jaws of a leech and the embrace of neurotically sweaty buttocks... maybe a piece of still-warm, newly born faeces... Imagine how popular they would be with the flies. What we would all be if our minds could defy change and not reflect shadows. The shadows of the moratorium of a postadolescence that persistently doubts. <p/> No doubt, this is the submission of a bookishly moody moth who will fancy that this is what it is today. He's been offered a slice of classic Australian literature to digest, from the pen of David Malouf, the multi-award-winning kangaroo, fiction writer, poet and novelist. The novel in question, An Imaginary Life, is one of the so-called postcolonial reads. The motif of the ascetic who ventures across a vast, mostly inhospitable landscape to find himself in the isolation of isolation is a frequent one in Australian literature. This motif has, in fact, developed into a national mythology, and has thus helped to shape Australian cultural identity, certainly among the white, immigrant population. Aborigines have an ascetic for lunch, just as Australians have kangaroos. <p/> Anyway, in The Imaginary Life we are placed in ancient times, in the shoes of the witty Roman poet Ovid, who is no ordinary, voluntary ascetic. We know from glimpses of his real life that he was the celebrated author of the Metamorphoses, a poet who knew how to articulate most beautifully the lazy decadence of his time, a man who not only moved in the heartland but was the very heart of Roman high society. And the heart is that missing part of the human toolbox which the then Emperor Augustus forgot when, for reasons unknown to us, he had Ovid exiled to the very edge of the Roman Empire, to an emergency civilised barbarian settlement. The unfortunate poet was left without bread, without games. And for him, the fiction is just beginning. <p/> In the emptiness of the desert landscape, Ovid of Maloof finds himself in profound silence, for Latin is not the barbarians' personal hygiene. The saddened poet is left with no choice but to put on his hair, roll in shit and surrender to the unbearability of silence. At this point, we find ourselves in the framework of a colonial discourse, which is expressed through the absence of a familiar environment, language and, consequently, an unresolved identity. <p/> The author thus focuses on the mental aporias and inner conflicts of the protagonist rather than on a narrative description of his surroundings. Here, however, the novel's multilayered nature gradually comes to the fore, leaving its central motif open to a multitude of interpretations. Is An Imaginary Life a novel about the search for identity and the importance of language in shaping it, a poetic reflection on the nature of life and death, on transcending boundaries in the landscape and in ourselves, on maturing through relationships with others? It leaves the layers of meaning to the horizon of imagination and thinking beyond the anxieties of civilisation. <p/> The cynicism of the cultivated poet Ovid, however, begins to diminish when he encounters the Child, a wild boy from the nearby forest. The little unsocialised hairy creature, who croaks, howls and generally disregards the behavioural patterns of the proudly standing specimens of modern homo sapiens, gradually reveals to him that civilisation is not an incurable disease. The story ends in an embrace of existentialist kitsch and pantheistic idealisations about nature. Flower children will thus be thrilled to read Imaginary Life. Lonely cowboys will be enlightened. Friends of trees will sprout leaves instead of hair. You'll want to ask a praying mantis out on a date.

__label__subjective News <p/> Archive <p/> Data protection with second-generation deduplication technology <p/> Monday 13 August 2012 <p/> Proper data protection is like an insurance policy. Most of the time it is not cashed in, but it is crucial if problems or damage actually occur. The cost of "insurance" in data protection is not only the cost of the equipment and its maintenance, but also the negative impact on business processes if, for example, archiving or restoring data takes too long, if data in remote locations of the company is not adequately protected, or if things are simply not regulated according to the law. <p/> As a direct response to these issues, technologies emerged a few years ago that have had a significant impact on improving archiving processes. In addition to the significant cheapening of hard disks, the development of data deduplication technology has been crucial. While the first generation of this technology brought some benefits to users, it was known even then that most of its potential still lay ahead. HP's deduplication development strategy was launched in 2010 and today the second generation of deduplication delivers improvements in areas such as performance, scalability and data management. StoreOne technology, as it is called, is based on a single deduplication algorithm developed in HP labs and runs on all HP hardware and software data protection solutions. In other words, deduplication technology can be implemented on the HP B6000, HP D2D2500 and HP D2D4000 series of products, and is fully supported by HP Data Protector archive software. A quick look at the main competitor, EMC, quickly reveals that its solutions are based on three mutually incompatible platforms (Data Domain, Avamar, Celerra) (Edison Group report, 2011), which is a stark difference to the single, unified architecture offered by HP.<p>Where does the shoe pinch the hardest when it comes to data protection? <p/> There is a general consensus that the following areas are particularly critical in relation to data protection, and that they weigh on users in one way or another: <p/> Time windows available for archiving <p/> The biggest challenge is to archive more and more data in less and less time. HP is responding to this with what it calls a "scale-out" architecture, which allows users to buy only the capacity and performance they really need, rather than having to buy both categories in stock. At the moment, HP's scale-up ends with 768 TB of gross capacity and an archiving speed of around 100 TB/hour. <p/> Data recovery after catastrophic events <p/> It is essential that data is stored in locations that allow it to be recovered in the event of a catastrophic event. There are a number of options for data replication over low bandwidth data links, as only deduplicated data travels between sites. StoreOnce technology allows data deduplication to happen wherever it is desired, either directly at the application or source where the data originates, at the archive server, or directly on the device where the data is stored. Deduplication can, of course, happen before the data is transferred from one location to another, so multiple copies of the same data can be archived in multiple locations at the same time. <p/> Protecting data in remote locations <p/> For companies that operate in multiple locations or even in multiple countries and continents, data is widely dispersed and often not sufficiently protected. With StoreOnce technology, data can be accessed or restored from a central location, no matter where it is. <p/> Data recovery capabilities <p/> Investing in archive solutions means nothing if data cannot be recovered in a reasonable time. Most vendors still focus mainly on archiving capacity, but forget about recovery and usually do not even publish this information to avoid embarrassment. HP's solutions are very much at the forefront here, offering speeds of up to 30 TB/hour, the highest among comparable solutions. <p/> StoreOnce Catalyst <p/> StoreOnce Catalyst (API toolset) is a new enhancement to archive solutions and allows deduplicated data to be moved directly from the archive application between StoreOnce systems, without the need to "rehydrate" it first, i.e. bring it back to a baseline state. StoreOnce Catalyst also allows replication of data from one location to multiple locations simultaneously and cascading of data between locations in a deduplicated format (leveraging narrow bandwidth connections). StoreOnce Catalyst technology is also integrated into HP Data Protector 7 software, making it particularly suitable for smaller businesses. <p/> Integration into your environment <p/> StoreOnce technology is widely supported (it is supported by a growing number of market-leading archiving software solutions), so you don't need to change archiving software if you don't want to, for example, when you buy a D2D2500 system. But if that's not a barrier, there are a number of good reasons why you should take a closer look at HP Data Protector. HP Data Protector uses the StoreOnce deduplication algorithm, which makes it easy to transfer deduplicated data to any StoreOnce hardware. <p/> 2. Data Protector supports contextual search of archived data, which means that data with specific content can be recovered, not just data with a specific naming convention (filename). This is made possible by the integrated "Intelligent Data Operating Layer (IDOL)" from Autonomy, which has been under HP's umbrella for some time. <p/> What about archiving to tape? <p/> For long-term data archiving, tape drives continue to be offered in a wide variety of configurations, as there is still a significant demand for them in the market. The fact is that long-term archiving to tape is still by far the cheapest option.

__label__subjective DOG - A CREATURE FOR THE LONELY? <p/> Living with an animal is good for the body and soul. Children who are lucky enough to grow up around animals develop more feeling (empathy) for others, the ability to accept the differences between living things, their communication is fuller (it is easier for them to perceive correctly something besides words). They also have fewer allergies and express their emotions more easily. <p/> The above is said in an uiber simple way, in a homey way, a la Nina (jest). But it is an officially recognised fact that. So I did not make it up. <p/> I can tell you from my own experience in therapy with a dog (I don't have many, but I have a few) that children really do sometimes - when they have problems with this - open up more easily to a dog than to a human. Why? Because the dog does not judge. For him you are great when you are sad and when you are happy. It doesn't take your sadness or disappointment as an attack on its personality. So it accepts who you are. And it tries to improve your mood. Even when he is the cause of your disappointment, he doesn't take it out on his own resentment or hurt, but approaches it in a constructive way, trying to make amends in any way he can. It's funny for me to think like that... Funny that a higher evolved being, i.e. a human being, has to learn this extra many times, but a dog is just given it. So, on that point, I say calmly (and I don't mind if someone jumps in the loft about it)... Well, I will say that in some cases, at this point, the dog is more advanced than the human in terms of social skills. In some cases. I just find insensitivity to another's pain an extremely frightening trait. <p/> I have often heard the statement: lonely people have dogs. I always come to two conclusions from this statement, whether it is written or spoken and in what context: <p/> it reflects a person who thinks that he is an extra good soul just because he sometimes gets involved with someone. He does not know that this is not dictated by his character, but by the fact that he is born a social being. There are many ways to be involved with anyone. Roughly in 2 ways: bad or good. If I (magari with the help of animals) had conquered the good, I would know that this statement dilutes by negativity something that does not even need a negative connotation. If you like flowers, you like flowers, if you like animals, you like animals. If you like them, they are not superfluous. Just as simple as that. There is no need for pejorative approaches and words that can only bring pain when a person is belittled and nothing else. To me, that is hypocritical. A lack of understanding of acceptance of other living beings, garnished with the cellophane of (supposedly) trying to understand. A person with feeling for others would not express it that way. He would have benefited from the example of canine companionship. But I am glad he does not. Because it's not the dog's fault. He is not a doormat, he is a living being. <p/> Of course, a dog is a wonderful companion. Among other things because, as I said above, he knows how to coexist. Calm souls show emotions and moods in a relaxed way. We humans are not always and everywhere good at that. When we grow up, we are... well, less uninhibitedly genuine. He is also a wonderful listener and as a rule does not give away secrets. Intermezzo: those who know their animals, or animals in general, well know that they also tell some secrets. Just not, as a rule, in such an extreme way as the currently still famous bullmastiffs. Such expressions are maddeningly rare, because very few animals are so totally nerved - destroyed. I, for example, years ago, denounced my landlord for charging around the flat when I was not at home because of animals. Because I know my animals. In a humiliated confession, he then asked me - how did you know, since I hadn't moved anything? But there is no substitute for human closeness. That goes both ways, of course. No human being can replace a dog's closeness either. And the fact is that the dog as a companion really helps the desperate... because it gets them out, with people! ! ! Not because it replaces them. Because it cheers them up and brings them back to sociability. All this, of course, does not mean that all dog owners are the same. Hello? Are all parents the same? All rugby players? All at the same school? The important thing to say here is that the overly desperate don't snog the dog anyway. Fact. And that like-minded people walking their dogs is no worse than like-minded people playing volleyball.
__label__subjective Storks in Franko's settlement <p/> Škofja Loka - About two months ago, a pair of storks were spotted by the residents of Franko's settlement in Škofja Loka, and they started to build a nest in order to look after their brood. "In our area, every spring we see storks in the Sorje field. There are not many of them, but we are happy to see them, and this is the first time that we have had a stork family nesting here," said Franc Cegnar, master of the Sorisko polje Hunting Family. This interesting and unusual long-legged bird family for the Škofja region is a joy to observe for both hunters and locals, including the care of the parents, who bring some food for their offspring every day from Sorško polje in their beaks.

__label__subjective Jerry is leaving <p/> If you wanted to add symbolism to the script for the end of Andre Jerman's career, you would actually have only two options: win or lose. Unfortunately, fate chose the latter. The best Slovenian downhill skier of all time and still the only winner of a World Cup race on the men's side did not want to take much time to think about the next steps after his recent accident in Kitzbühel. <p/> As if he wanted to get rid of the burden as quickly as possible and push the stone away from his heart, he announced his appearance in front of the seventh force shortly after his return to Tržič. Although his announcement was expected, it was far from easy. "Number 36 was the last number I wore. It was time to say goodbye to a sport that has given me so much. It was not an easy decision. It was already difficult to come back this year and ' throw myself ' upside down. A period of no real results followed. In Wengen I got a new mark, my knee got stuck. But I did it anyway. I almost fell in the race too. I told my wife that I would decide after Kitzbühel. Well, Kitzbühel decided for me. If I had been healthy, I would have persevered. But when you don't feel the right conviction and confidence in yourself, you have to stop. I am happy with my career. I have always given my best. Sometimes maybe even too much. Me and the team have worked miracles. I was privileged to be able to play this sport and do what made me happy. Most people dream of a life like that. I had that opportunity. I was also lucky enough to have the right people by my side who supported me," the 34-year-old Tržič skier said with a shaking voice at the headquarters of the Slovenian Ski Federation, where he has been coming for champagne and for tough negotiations with the management in recent years. <p/> Andrej Jerman started his career in his home village of Zelenica, and has impressed in Weng, Bormio, Kitzbühl, Garmisch... Although his announcement was expected, it was far from easy for him. "Number 36 was the last number I wore. It was time to say goodbye to a sport that has given me so much. It was not an easy decision. It was already difficult to come back this year and ' throw myself ' upside down. A period of no real results followed. In Wengen I got a new mark, my knee got stuck.

I was also lucky enough to have the right people by my side who supported me," the 34-year-old Tržič skier said with a shaking voice at the headquarters of the Slovenian Ski Federation, where he has been coming for champagne and for tough negotiations with the management in recent years. <p/> Jerman's competitive reputation brings to an end one of the most successful careers in the history of Slovenian Alpine skiing, and most of all, in all likelihood, the most surprising and unexpected. For a long time, after all, Slovenians were considered to be only technical skiers with a daring excursion into the supervelles slalom. Jerman, on the other hand, made history in downhill, the fastest and for many the royal discipline. He will always be remembered as the first Slovenian winner of a World Cup downhill event. He was not a one-day flyer either, winning twice and finishing second and third, proving his quality and showing his mettle on a variety of terrain. His stability and excellence are also reflected in his breakthrough into the elite seven of the World Cup. He has finished two seasons in a row among the fastest. With a slight time lag, his skiing transformation was followed by his progression in the Super-G, where he never reached the podium, but finished fourth twice. <p/> His pioneering achievements paved the way for his compatriots. Already when he was breaking through, the national team formed a team for the fast disciplines under the leadership of Jože Gazvoda, his father, who was also a skier. After a few flashes from Peter Pena, Gašper Šparovec and before that Ales Brezavšek, "Jerry" was the first to prove that it is not an end in itself and that it is worth investing in the ski ranks. The "speedsters" were getting bigger and better, and as a result, the technical defector Andrej Šporn, Rok Perko, Alek Glebov, Gašper Markič and finally the promising Boštjan Kline started to make their way to the World Cup. <p/> It started very early, far away from the cameras. At the age of 13, he ended his skiing on the Soriška planina mountain when he collided with a spruce tree and broke both his legs. But it was at that point in his career that his stubbornness and perseverance came to the fore. A year later, he won the traditional Ponochio Cup and went on to show his talent in all age categories. Unfortunately, along with his skiing skills, he then brought a wave of injuries to the competition. The recent fall in Kitzbühel was not his only one at Streif. He paid the price of youthful enthusiasm and perhaps too little respect in his first encounter with the famous slope. He left the Rooster Ridge with damaged knee ligaments. Shortly after his rehabilitation, he broke it again, this time on the Zermatt glacier, and once again his knee was struck. Then, just when it looked like he had fulfilled his injury bonus, he fell again in 2004 and injured his knee for a third time. With all these injuries, the wrist fracture and the shoulder pain after falling off the chairlift are marginal. <p/> More fatal for Jerman was a fall at the start of the 2011/12 season, when he was already contemplating the end of his career after crashing into the guardrail of the Birds of Prey track in Beaver Creek. But he decided to rehab his injured knee and return to the World Cup caravan. He went ahead with his plan, but another fall prevented him from completing it. This time in Kitzbühel. Although it was "only" a concussion, and fortunately the ligaments and bones remained intact, it was the last one of his career. <p/> Martin Pavčnik, Siol.net <p/> Biggest successes: 2 World Cup ski race wins (Garmisch 2006/07 and Bormio 2009/10) and two more top 3 finishes.

__label__objective payment of wage differential - wage compensation - wage compensation for the time spent waiting for placement or employment in another suitable job - disabled person - enjoyment of disability insurance rights acquired under previous legislation - disability compensation - compensation for the time spent waiting - rights under the Social Insurance Act-1 <p/> The plaintiff has acquired the right to compensation for the time spent waiting for placement or employment in another suitable job under the Pension and Disability Insurance Act, and is therefore not entitled to compensation under the Social Insurance Act (ZZPIZ-1)<p/> The plaintiff is entitled to compensation under the Social Insurance Act. <Operative part of the judgment under appeal is partially allowed and the judgment under appeal is amended in point II of the operative part of the judgment (decision on costs) by reducing the amount awarded to EUR 513,00. The remainder of the appeal is dismissed and the judgment under appeal of the Court of First Instance is upheld in part and unchanged. <The parties are ordered to bear their own costs of the appeal. <p/> Reasoning <p/> By the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action brought by the applicant seeking an order that the defendant account to her for the gross amount of EUR 3 505,04 in respect of the underpayment of the salary allowance, pay the prescribed taxes and contributions and then pay to her the net sums, together with statutory default interest on the net sums on the gross basis, as set out in paragraph I/1 of the operative part of the judgment. Dismisses the applicant's claim for reimbursement of the costs of the proceedings (paragraph I/2 of the operative part of the judgment) and orders the applicant to reimburse the costs of the proceedings in the sum of EUR 729,96 to the defendant within 15 days (paragraph II of the operative part of the judgment). <p/> The applicant timely appeals against the judgment on all grounds of appeal under Article 338(1) of the Civil Procedure Act (C.P.A., Official Gazette of the RS, No 26/99 et seq.) and requests the Court of Appeal to uphold its appeal and to alter the judgment under appeal by granting the application in full and, in the alternative, to set aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial and to order the defendant to pay the costs of the appeal. The judgment is based, according to the applicant, on an incorrect and incomplete finding of fact and on an error of substantive law. In the light of the clear statutory provisions, the applicant should have been paid 100 % of the allowance for the time spent waiting for homeworking. The defendant issued the applicant with an order to wait for work at home because it did not have suitable work for her. Notwithstanding the fact that the applicant did not appeal against the decisions of the ZPIZ of 31 March 2003 or the defendant's decision of 25 May 2001, she cannot, in her view, be denied the right to the difference since, during the period at issue, that is to say, from April 2005 to July 2007, the compensation for the time spent waiting for work was governed by the Labour Relations Act (LSA, Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No 42/2002 et seq.). The decision of 31.1.2003 of the ZPIZ did not, by anything in the operative part of the decision, decide that the compensation was 80 %, but only that it was compensation for the time spent waiting for work from 7.7.2001 onwards in the amount of SIT 71 011,61. The 80 % allowance was decided by the defendant by decision of 25.5.2001, against which decision the applicant had no grounds for appeal, since ZDR-02 was not yet in force and, moreover, that decision was not based on the provisions of the Social Insurance Act or the Social Insurance Act, but on Article 34 of the sectoral collective agreement. <p/> The appeal also challenges the decision on costs. The Court of First Instance held five main hearings, at which it took evidence and heard both parties on two occasions, and it was only after that that it decided that the claim was unfounded and could therefore have ordered that each party should bear its own costs. However, if the applicant had to pay any costs to the defendant, the Court of First Instance could have awarded the defendant only one award for the proceedings under No 3012, notwithstanding the fact that the Court of First Instance had reopened the main hearing, and the appellant therefore proposes that the Court of Appeal should make a decision as to the costs of the proceedings in such a way that each party should bear its own costs or that the costs awarded to the defendant should be reduced. <p/> In its response to the appeal, the defendant contested the grounds of appeal as unfounded and requested the Court of Appeal to dismiss the appeal and to order the applicant to pay the defendant's costs of the appeal. <p/> The appeal is partly well founded. <p/> The Court of Appeal examined the judgment under appeal within the limits of the grounds of appeal raised, taking into account, on its own motion, the substantive breaches of the provisions of Article 350(2) of the Civil Procedure Act (C.P.A., Official Journal of the Republic of Slovenia, No 26/99 et seq.) 1.points 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 11, with the exception of the existence and correctness of the authorisation to proceed before the court of first instance, and points 12 and 14 of the second paragraph of Article 339 of the Civil Procedure Code, and the correct application of substantive law. In that examination, the Court of First Instance found that the Court of First Instance had not committed any of the substantive infringements of the provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure which the Court of Appeal is required to take into account of its own motion. It also correctly applied the substantive law to the facts correctly and fully established and only the decision on costs was partially erroneous, as will be explained below. <p/> The Court of Appeal fully agrees with the legal and factual grounds of the contested judgment of the Court of First Instance (with the exception of the decision on costs), and therefore does not repeat them and, as regards the grounds of appeal which are of decisive importance pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 360(1) of the ECHR, the Court of First Instance does not rely on them in the present case. <p/> The Court of First Instance correctly found that the applicant was entitled, in view of her ability to work, to a wage allowance for the period of waiting for placement or employment in another suitable job under the provisions of the Pension and Disability Insurance Act (ZPIZ-1, Official Gazette of the Republic of Poland, No. 1, item 360, as amended). No ... of 4 October 2000, in conjunction with the decision of the Pension and Disability Insurance Institute of Slovenia, Regional Unit A. No ... of 27 March 2001, she was classified in category III of disability due to the effects of the disease and with the right to assignment or employment in other suitable work of a physically lighter nature from 29 September 2000 onwards. The applicant was awarded compensation by decision of the Pension and Invalidity Insurance Institute of Slovenia, Regional Unit A., No ... of 31 January 2003, which provided that the employer was to pay the applicant's salary compensation at its own expense. The Employment Relations Act (ZDR, Official Gazette of the RS, No 42/2002) had indeed entered into force before that decision was issued, but the essential point is that the applicant had already acquired the right before that date, and that decision therefore conferred on her the right to wage compensation for the period of her waiting for assignment to another suitable job as from 7.7.2001, on the basis of the provisions of the ZPIZ-1 and the Pension and Disability Insurance Act (ZPIZ, Official Gazette of the RS, Nos 12/92 to 54/98). Pursuant to Article 397 of the ZPIZ-1, beneficiaries of rights on the basis of residual capacity for work established under the regulations applicable until the date laid down in Article 446 of this Law, which is 1 January 2003, shall retain those rights after that date, with the proviso that the cash benefits shall be adjusted as pensions are adjusted. The applicant has always been a category III invalid, but it was only by decision of 26.10.2009 that she was classified as a category I invalid as a result of illness from 9.4.2009 and was granted the right to an invalidity pension from 1.5.2009. The appellant's claims that the Court of First Instance failed to establish the facts in full and erred in the application of the substantive law are therefore unfounded. <p/> The Court of Appeal adds that even an appeal by the applicant against the decision of the ZPIZ of 31 March 2003 would not alter the fact that the applicant has acquired the right to a benefit under the rules on pension and invalidity insurance and is therefore not entitled to a benefit under the ZDR. The appellant's submissions that the amount of the applicant's allowance was fixed by the defendant by decision of 25 May 2001 are also unfounded, since the amount of the allowance was fixed by a decision of the ZPIZ of 31 January 2003 in the amount of SIT 71 011,61 per month. In accordance with Article 137 of the ZPIZ, in conjunction with Article 48 of the ZPIZ-1, the minimum pension base was taken as the basis on which the salary allowance for the period of waiting for employment or assignment to other suitable work was calculated, at a rate of 80 %, and the allowance thus calculated was adjusted in the same way as the pensions and amounted to SIT 71 011,61 as from 7.7.2001. <p/> On the basis of the foregoing, the Court of First Instance correctly rejected the applicant's claim for payment of the difference between the amount of compensation received for the period of waiting for work, which was 80 % of the basic amount, and 100 % of the amount of compensation under Article 137 of the Labour Code. <p/> The appellant, however, submits that the Court of First Instance erred in its assessment of the defendant's necessary legal costs, which the appellant is liable to reimburse. Notwithstanding the fact that the Court of First Instance reopened the main hearing, the defendant is entitled, pursuant to Tariff No 3012 of the Law on the Tariff of Lawyers (Law on the Tariff of Lawyers, Official Gazette of the RS 67/2008), to only one hearing fee, and the Court of Appeal therefore reduced the amount of the costs awarded to EUR 513,00, namely one hearing fee of EUR 190,80 and VAT of 20 % on that amount. However, the Court of First Instance had no basis for deciding, as the appeal suggests, that each party should bear its own costs, since the applicant was unsuccessful in the proceedings. <p/> In the light of the foregoing, the Court of Appeal upheld the applicant's appeal in part in so far as it related to the decision on the costs of the appeal and reduced the amount awarded to EUR 513,00 (Article 351(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, read in conjunction with Article 358(5) of the Civil Procedure Code), dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment under appeal of the Court of First Instance in the remaining part (Article 353 of the Civil Procedure Code), without any change in that amount. <p/> The applicant was only partially successful in its appeal and the Court of Appeal therefore decided, pursuant to Article 154(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, read in conjunction with Article 165(1) of the same Act, that it should bear its own costs of the appeal.

The selected Quality Advisers will carry out the planned quality development activities through meetings at the Andragogical Centre of Slovenia, while the rest of the quality development work will be carried out concurrently in their own organisations, for 32 hours per month. <p/> At the first meeting, which took place on 26 June 2012. <p/> The participants of the first meeting of the Adult Education Quality Advisors project <p/> received basic information about the content and the way of working in the project, <p/> got acquainted with the role of a quality advisor in adult education, <p/> got acquainted with one of the qualitative methods for assessing and developing quality, namely the peer assessment method, <p/> and got acquainted with an overview of the published content on the web on assessing and developing the quality of education for adults.<p/> The participants of the first meeting of the project were invited to participate in the project. <p/> At the second meeting, on 9 March 2011, the participants devoted their full attention to preparing for the collegial visit to the six selected training organisations. <p/> Dr Tanja Možina with participants during the preparation of the peer review of the self-evaluation report <p/> In terms of the role of peer reviewers, they learned: <p/> how to judge a self-evaluation report and give a peer review, <p/> how to prepare for a discussion with different stakeholders (director/principal, teachers, participants, educational organisers... ), <p/> how to give feedback to the organisation hosting the visit, and <p/> how to prepare a record of the peer review visit which will be used as a basis for the preparation of the final report. <p/> In terms of the role of the coordinators of a collegiate visit in an educational organisation, they learnt: <p/> how to prepare for a collegiate visit in an organisation and <p/> what to look out for during and at the end of the visit. <p/> Through role-playing, the participants also role-played the process of the peer auditors' group discussion with the head teacher, a teacher, a member of the quality team and the quality advisor. The other participants acted as observers of the conversation. <p/> During the period 21 April to 24 May 2011, peer visits took place in six educational organisations. The subject of the audit during the peer visits was the internal quality system used by the educational organisations. Each organisation was audited by a team of three peer auditors who, prior to the visit, reviewed the self-evaluation report, prepared an audit against pre-defined criteria and prepared audit questions to shed further light on certain aspects or to clarify certain information contained in the report. <p/> Hosts of the Peer Visits discussing their impressions of the preparation and implementation of the Peer Review <p/> At the third meeting, held on 7 June 2011, the participants first discussed their impressions of the Peer Review method and then received some guidance on how to prepare the final Peer Review report. In the second part of the meeting, participants learned about the preparation of the Quality Charter document, discussed how to establish the role of the Quality Adviser in the collectives and how to set up a quality subpage on the website. <p/> At the fourth meeting, on 4 October 2011, which was also the final meeting of 2011, we evaluated the peer review process together with the participants and discussed the planned quality improvements in educational organisations. We also agreed on further work on the Quality Charter and reviewed what information related to quality and adult learning is published on the website. <p/> In the second part of the meeting, we evaluated the role of the Quality Adviser in the participating educational organisations and discussed the activities until the end of the project Education and Training of Professionals in Adult Education 2009-2011 and the activities for the continuation of the project Education and Training of Professionals in Adult Education 2011-2014. <p/> During the group work on the evaluation of the role of the quality advisor in the participating educational organisations <p/> In this way, the participants evaluated and demonstrated their work in the role of the quality advisor.

Today, after the end of the Kočevje Assembly of the legal successor of the CPSU, a typical DISINFORMATION ARTICLE appeared in Delo, entitled Circular 2, in which the editorial board publishes as pure truth purely exaggerated things at the expense of the Ministry of Education and all the rest. It is a completely calsic agitprop, which was commonplace under totalitarianism, but in a democracy can hardly be classified as an acceptable way of doing journalism! Even the cultural Our Four, by a poet who was supposed to be a mere culturalist, has quite obviously been classified as an agitprop achievement of those who think that power is reserved and inalienable for them!

__label__subjective Happy hillbillies at the Philharmonic! <p/> 09 Apr 2012 <p/> There is a lot to learn from all history, including folk-music history. There is only one aspect to this: whether the musician has something to gain from the experience of others, or whether he or she has simply stood still all his or her life. A shining example of how wide one should spread one's wings is the Veseli Hribovci ensemble from Ljubljana. <p/> Veseli hribovci was active for twenty years, led by the academically trained musician Stane Žnuderl, who was usually also the author of the music and lyrics, and who always ensured a high level of performance for those times.The ensemble was extremely popular both in Slovenia and abroad (in the German-speaking area, of course, it was called Die lustigen Bergsteiger), and it also performed in the most important Slovene cultural centres, and it was always in search of the new, the different, the original. Although the Merry Hillmen appeared on the then Radio Ljubljana only in 1959, they had already played two years earlier, but without radio ambitions. The very origins of the ensemble are interesting. They performed the operetta Na planincah naszych (On Our Mountains) at the KUD Vič in Ljubljana, for which the libretto was written by Miha Kunaver and the Veseli hribovci leader Stane Žnuderl wrote the music. When I met him a few times, he always got very angry at such memories, because he could not understand that some radio and television editors, who get their salaries from RTV subscriptions, cannot or will not listen to their listeners. But he also got angry at the idea that there was nothing wrong with local music, it just needed to be brought up to the right level. It was the quality of the music that made the Merry Hills people one of the first to appear on the radio programme Thursday Evening of Local Songs and Hymns, as guests on the first television programmes and on many radio programmes in the field. Back then, it was also the case that the editors of other programmes tried to bring the most popular groups, especially folk-entertainment groups, to the field. Žnuderl was fond of telling anyone who disparaged local music: "We also performed at the Slovenian Philharmonic, where we - probably one of the few, if not the only ones - played no less than seven polkas and waltzes. And live, in front of the TV cameras. I myself began by whistling the entire first movement of one of my compositions, which created a real enthusiasm among the audience. "The Merry Mountaineers were among the first to follow the Avseniks across national borders, which were still very closed at that time. In Austria, Germany and Switzerland, they always sang in Slovene. On the other hand, they were so inventive that they performed the song dedicated to the town of Kindberg in both languages and gave the notes to the mayor of the town. Although at that time we were still seen by many as part of the underdeveloped Balkans, this approach convinced everyone and opened the way forward. It is no wonder that the Merry Hillmen recorded 78 songs for German-speaking audiences. And thanks to Žnuderl, they were always among those at home who were looking for a new expression. They were probably the first to add zithers to a quintet in one of their songs, Peter Ambrož, a member of the Slovenian Octet, sang with the Veseli hribovci, and they recorded a large vinyl album with the Stari Ljubljančani, legendary singers, including the Lumbar brothers, members of what were probably the most popular radio singers of the time, the Fantje na vasi (Boys in the Village). To put it another way: Stane Žnuderl never slept on the laurels of his first successes, but always tried to add something new and original to the new ones, and the quintet itself was set up in such a way that it was recognisable from afar. The release of each of their new albums was a great event, as was each public performance. On top of that, the Veseli hribovci from Ljubljana were also good-hearted. They donated a sum that was seven times Žnuderl's professor's salary for the construction of their home in Debele Rtič. It means that all the musicians really had a good heart and that their basic mission was not - as in many cases today - just to make sure that they performed as much as possible for the sake of earning money, everything else being of secondary importance.
__label__objective Which foods are good to eat together and which are not <p/> It is often food combinations that complicate the metabolism. If we don't eat the right combinations, even healthy foods don't help us. <p/> 1. Don't eat protein and starch together Avoid eating simple carbohydrates and protein in one meal. Do not combine bread, rice and cereals with fish, eggs, meat, milk and dairy products. The body needs an alkaline base to process starch and acids to process protein. This combination causes bloating, abdominal pain, indigestion, etc. <p/> 2. Eat protein only with vegetables <p/> 3. Eat starch only with vegetables Combine starchy foods such as rice, potatoes and pasta only with vegetables. <p/> 4. Fruit Eat fruit 2 hours before, or after a meal. Fruit is so special in every way that you will gain the most from digesting it on its own. It is important that fruit triggers the fermentation process, which in combination with other foods can interfere with other metabolic processes. Be careful with melons. Melons are faster to digest than other fruits, so be careful when mixing fruits together. <p/> 5. Don't mix starch and sugar Cookies can be really hard to resist, but when you mix starch and sugar in your mouth, enzymes are secreted to break down the starch, and the sugar makes your body acidic. Acidity slows down the breakdown of starch and you are trapped in an unsolvable digestive loop. <p/> 6. Do not combine milk with anything Pasteurisation destroys the enzymes that stimulate digestion. Milk starts to coagulate when it reaches the stomach and this slows down the digestion of other foods. Of course, this applies only to cow's milk. <p/> 7. Avoid sugar The problem of sweets is even greater because most of us already have a portion of protein, starch and carbohydrates in our stomachs. All of this further complicates digestion. In this case, we like to say that some food is stuck in our stomach, which is actually true, because the metabolic methods are mutually exclusive. You may have heard somewhere that it would be better to eat desserts half an hour before a meal. The benefit would be twofold: a large part of your metabolism would have been done by the time you had your main meal, and you would be less hungry and eat less. <p/> vkj

__label__objective Nicotine addiction <p/> Nicotine addiction is a complex phenomenon that depends primarily on the absorption and metabolism of nicotine. In addition to sociological factors, our genetic make-up has a particularly important influence, as it can explain more than 50 % of the total risk of nicotine dependence. <p/> Scientists are discovering new genes with smaller effects alongside the well-known genes with large effects, such as CHRNA3, which have contributed significantly to understanding the biological mechanism of addiction. Nicotine acts on the acetylcholine receptor family in the brain because it is structurally similar to the brain chemical carrier acetylcholine. Binding of nicotine to such a receptor triggers the opening of ion channels on the cell membrane and the release of new neurotransmitters in the brain that induce feelings of pleasure. Chronic exposure to nicotine causes changes in the receptors, which can become less sensitive or even inactive. Changes also occur in the metabolism of nerve cells. All these changes can cause a smoker to fall into a withdrawal crisis when he or she stops smoking. <p/> More details on nicotine dependence <p/> Add to these facts the link between smoking and heart attack, lung disease and cancers of the tongue, throat and lungs, and you have enough reasons to quit. However, this is often where a major problem arises. The World Health Organisation estimates that less than 5% of people who have tried to quit smoking unaided persist one year after their last cigarette. This is due to nicotine dependence influenced by genetic factors. <p/> Nicotine dependence is a complex phenomenon that depends, among other things, on nicotine absorption and metabolism. Different people react very differently to the same amount of nicotine, which is determined by genetic factors. They can explain more than 50 of the risks of nicotine dependence. Scientists are discovering new genes to further explain the causes of nicotine dependence, which could go a long way towards solving the problem of addiction. <p/> Understanding the biological mechanism of addiction has made a significant contribution to the search for genes that might influence nicotine dependence. Nicotine acts on the acetylcholine receptor family in the brain because it is structurally similar to the brain chemical carrier acetylcholine. Binding of nicotine to such a receptor triggers the opening of ion channels on the cell membrane and the release of new neurotransmitters in the brain that induce feelings of pleasure. Chronic exposure to nicotine causes changes in the receptors, which can become less sensitive or even inactive. There are also changes in the metabolism of nerve cells. All these changes can cause a smoker to fall into a withdrawal crisis when he or she stops smoking. <p/> One of the first European smokers <p/> One of the first smokers in Europe was Rodrigo de Jerez, a member of Christopher Columbus' expedition. When he returned to his hometown, the smoke from his mouth and nose frightened his neighbours so much that they reported him to the Inquisitors. He was imprisoned for 7 years! It is also interesting to note that tobacco smoking used to be attributed with healing effects. In 1571, the Spanish physician Nicolas Monardes, in his book, attributed to tobacco the healing power for 36 different health problems
__label__subjective When you're depressed: goat's yoghurt curd <p/> This time, we're going to have a little treat. We've prepared a delicious goat's yoghurt clotted cream that is sure to indulge your taste buds and put you in a better mood. <p/> Nutritionist's tip: <p/> Goat's milk and goat's milk products <p/> Everyone experiences symptoms such as anxiety, sadness, depression, despair. If these symptoms last for a long time, we can talk about depression. In this case, we may be deficient in serotonin, a neurotransmitter that reduces tension, calms us down and helps us to feel good and sleep better. Serotonin is made from tryptophan, an amino acid that is abundant in cheese, eggs, white meat, etc. To help you feel even better, I recommend eating foods rich in vitamin B6, folic acid and magnesium. <p/> Today's dessert is made up of lots of good quality foods. I would particularly like to highlight the goat's milk products. Goat's milk is slowly gaining a little more attention in our country. How could it not, since it has many health-giving properties. I would like to point out that goat's milk is basically easier to digest than cow's milk and causes fewer allergies in people. It can therefore often be consumed by people who cannot tolerate cow's milk. <p/> Goat's milk is high in calcium, phosphorus, vitamin B12 (as well as other B-complex vitamins) and calcium. Goat's milk is also rich in the amino acid tyrosine, which helps to improve concentration and motivation. In addition, regular consumption of goat's milk and goat's milk products will make you feel calmer and reduce feelings of anxiety and inner tension. <p/> As a point of interest, goat's milk is also highly valued as a beauty product and its regular consumption is also thought to help ensure longevity. <p/> Now, let's get down to preparing our dessert...

The company had already abandoned sites in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the Austrian news agency APA reported. <Kastner & Öhler explained that the comparatively small Slovenian market has experienced negative trends in recent years and the economic situation is not very promising. "Withdrawing from Slovenia is therefore a logical consequence," the company said. <p/> Meanwhile, in Austria, Gigasport is developing steadily despite the difficulties. The cooperation with Sport 2000, which has developed into a strong partnership with suppliers, has contributed to this. <p/> In March, Gigasport will launch a new online shop, with a special focus on the close link between traditional and online business. <p/> In addition to the three offices mentioned above, Kastner & Öhler has one more store in Slovenia, K & Ö in Ljubljana. <p/> Kastner &amp; Öhler was the first foreign company with sports stores to operate in Slovenia.

__label__subjective Mechanical surface treatments, such as polishing and grinding, give aluminium profiles a distinctive look. Minor surface defects are removed, a uniform appearance is created and the surface is ready for further treatment (decorative surface). <p/> Polishing <p/> It can be carried out automatically or manually.

In etching-satinizing, the surface takes on a matt appearance, which varies depending on the type of aluminium alloy, the condition of the surface, the temperature and the processing time. These processes are also used as a pre-treatment for anodising. <p/> Electrochemical polishing <p/> This gives the aluminium a shiny surface, which is very delicate and therefore needs to undergo a further treatment - anodising - as soon as possible.

Dr. Maša Jazbec, Head of the DDTlab research laboratory, presented the interdisciplinary triangle, where innovative products and services for the future of human technology are developed, as well as experiences from abroad, especially from Japan and Linz, Austria, home to Ars Electronica, the world's largest and most important platform for media art. <p/> Dr Angelika Mlinar, Zoran Poznič and Aleš Bucik also visited the business accelerator Katapult, which successfully applied for European funding for the SIO-KATAPULT 2020-22 project in the Ministry of Economic Development and Technology's public call for proposals for the implementation of support services for entities of the innovative environment in the Republic of Slovenia 2020-2022. They learned about the innovative activities of the partner companies and discussed the European Cohesion Policy in the next financial perspective 2021-2027 and the possibilities of using other development resources besides the cohesion funds. They touched upon the opportunities for bringing together the natural and social sciences in areas such as information and communication technologies, the humanisation of technology, virtual and augmented reality, robotics, biotechnology and nanotechnology.

__label__subjective Press release - Taxi Drivers' Union at the 29th meeting on 04.05.2021 <p/> Adoption of the amendment to the law in favour of Ubr at the 29th meeting of the Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Spatial Planning <p/> On 4.5.2021, taxi drivers once again drove down Šubičeva Street to show their support for Dejan Jefim, the President of the Taxi Drivers' Union, who spoke in favour of the taxi drivers' position at the 29th meeting of the Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Spatial Planning, on the occasion of the draft law on amendments and additions to the Law on Road Transport (ZPCP-2I).On 5.5.2021, taxi drivers drove down Šubičeva Street to show their support for Dejan Jefim, the President of the Taxi Drivers' Union, at the 29th meeting of the Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Spatial Planning. <p/> During the meeting, Jefim highlighted the weaknesses of the amendment of the law due to the arrival of Uber, but unfortunately his opinion was not heard by the majority. We would also like to thank Sasha Kumer, Secretary General of the SDPZ, who also supported the taxi drivers' union at the meeting and gave the SDPZ's position. We would also like to thank the SAB, the Left Party, the LMŠ and the SD for their support. <p/> Despite the efforts of the union to raise the issue of changing the law in favour of Uber, unfortunately most of the cons did not want to hear it, they are all just making excuses, saying memorised sentences and avoiding real answers. <p/> With the efforts of taxi drivers and the help of the state, the quality of taxi services has improved dramatically over the last 10 years. Taxi meters have been made compulsory (annually certified and calibrated), a licence is required, a tourist examination, no criminal record, adequate financial standing - fixed assets, a roadworthiness test twice a year, special insurance for passengers, the introduction of cash registers, etc. <p/> With the current law, the State strongly regulates the taxi business and makes fraud impossible. However, by changing the law, the taxi business will be set back 30 years, so years of effort will be wiped out in a matter of months. Why? Simply because Uber has a different business model and cannot operate under our laws. <p/> The current government is silent on the fact that Uber will not pay a cent in tax on their profits. The current government is silent on the known facts of the problem of Uber drivers appearing abroad. The current government is silent on the fact that wherever Uber is present, there are major problems, read - robberies, rapes, beatings and even murders. The current government is silent on how it will protect consumers and the potential disputes and problems that will arise with the arrival of Uber, how and in what way the government will protect consumers and who consumers can turn to in order to resolve them. The current government is silent on the fact that a ride that today a consumer pays €5 for on the taximeter when Uber arrives will, according to their algorithms, also be €20 or more if demand is high at that moment. The current government is silent that the change in legislation does not do any good, not for the country, not for the taxi drivers, and least of all for the consumers. <p/> Despite the fact that we did not win the session and the change in the law was approved in the session, we will not stop, we will work for all taxi drivers and residents and their better future. We are concerned about the future and the safety of our citizens, that is why we are NOT against "competition", but we are against changing the law. <p/> Unlike the current government, we in the union are happy to see the cooperation and listening of local authorities. We are happy about the warm and positive reception at the MOL, we are happy that in the future in Ljubljana, in cooperation with the Mayor Mr Jankovič, we will bring the taxi business to the highest possible level, both with vehicles, drivers and prices that will be accessible to any user, regardless of the arrival of foreign platforms.
__label__subjective The history of hunting is as old as mankind. However, like man, the meaning of hunting has changed over time. Today, hunting is no longer a struggle for human survival, but is primarily about protecting nature and preserving wildlife so that we can preserve both for our descendants. <p/> Many people do not understand our mission, so in our LD Fram we have decided to present part of our activities to the people under the slogan Take care of the birds. <p/> So in 2011, we took part in a fair in the courtyard of the castle in the municipality of Rače - Fram with our presentation. Since we have 51 members, we symbolically made just as many bird feeders, for which wood was donated by farmers from our area. They also thought our idea was original and good. Then, with the help of the carpenters in our LD, we made the bird feeders. We also lit our logo on each one to remind the recipients of our charity. Of course, we didn't forget the bird feed we also asked for. <p/> Our LD has hunting horn players who take care of hunting music, which is part of hunting culture, and it was to them that the honour belonged to play the opening melodies and announce the start of the fair. We decorated our stand appropriately, as befits hunters, with our emblem, and we also provided food and drinks. <p/> The response of the visitors was very positive, as the food and feeders ran out quite quickly. We were also pleased, as we made contact with people and introduced them to our mission, our care for nature and wildlife.

__label__objective In November, the month of addiction prevention, members of the Local Action Group for Addiction Prevention will hold a series of expert lectures for parents of primary school children in Celje... <p/> The lectures, which will be organised this month at nine primary schools in the municipality of Celje, are aimed at parents of pupils in grades 6 to 9. The lecture programme is financially supported by the Municipality of Celje. The lectures will focus on the protective factors of education that can help to prevent drug use. Drugs, both licit and illicit, are increasingly being used by children. The lectures will also provide parents with information on what behavioural and physical changes to look out for when they suspect that their child has used drugs. Although the topic is topical, shedding light on effective parenting skills and communicating with children in conflict situations in addition to addiction problems, only 160 parents attended last year's series of lectures in eight primary schools. This time, the organisers hope for a better response. The series of lectures will be delivered by experts in medicine, psychology, social work and criminology.
__label__subjective Others about the event <p/> 7th Children's Bazaar Ljubljana: 2012 <p/> This is the second year in a row that Afrodita Cosmetics has participated in the Children's Bazaar. We recognised a great opportunity in the project to present our new BABY & KIDS NATURAL cosmetics to both existing and potential new customers. Considering the number of contacts established and the positive reactions from visitors, we believe that our participation in the Children's Bazaar has been extremely successful both years. We have fulfilled our main objective - to get closer to our target group of customers: mainly parents, but also toddlers. For the latter reason, we plan to participate in the Children's Bazaar again next year. <p/> Nastija Egartner Marketing Communication Kozmetika Afrodita d. o. o. <p/> The Children's Bazaar in Maribor and Ljubljana presented many opportunities for families to spend quality time together. That is why Sava Hotels & Resorts was not missing among the suppliers. While children were eagerly participating in children's workshops at our stand, their parents and older companions were interested in active holidays in our destinations. We are delighted to have recorded a large number of bookings for family holidays as a result of our presentation at the Otorka Bazaar, and we recommend this type of cooperation to other organisations and companies. <p/> Slavica Rešeta Market Administrator - Slovenia Sava Hotels & Resorts <p/> At the 7th Children's Bazaar Ljubljana, we had a very pleasant experience with the organiser of the fair, Proevent d.o.o., with our fair performance, where we presented the project "I like to eat fish". The staff of this company is characterised by their exceptional professionalism, professional and responsible attitude and their great sense of care for exhibitors and visitors. We look forward to working with them in the future. <p/> This is the first year we have participated in the Children's Bazaar in Ljubljana. Our company is still young, but we aim to be the best provider of developmental or didactic toys for children of all ages. The Children's Bazaar is the best way for us to get in touch with our customers and direct users of our toys. We were very satisfied with the attendance and the atmosphere on the fairground and we will definitely see you in 2013. <p/> Peter Goričan Singa d.o.o. <p/> 7th Children's Bazaar Ljubljana in the media <p/> As we are a very young company, this year was our first time participating in the Children's Bazaar. We were delighted with the atmosphere at the event, as there was really no shortage of positive energy. We achieved our business goals: we presented our organic cotton products for babies and toddlers to young parents and pregnant women. We had a unique response to our stand and got confirmation that we are heading in the right direction. This customer contact is very important for our online shop, so we will definitely be back next year. <p/> Alenka Bombažek d.o.o. <p/> Before the Children's Bazaar event there was a lot of apprehension about how critical visitors would react to our promotion of craft professions. Up to now, we have mainly targeted primary school pupils in the last third of the school year when promoting craft professions, but we were pleasantly surprised by the decision to focus on younger pupils this time. The response from the children, and especially from their parents, has been overwhelming. The Slovenian Chamber of Commerce and Industry would also like to highlight the exemplary cooperation with the organiser Proevent d.o.o. and would like to take this opportunity to thank them very much. <p/> Mitja Korunovski Education Centre of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry <p/> We participated in the Children's Bazaar for the second year in a row. Last year, when we participated for the first time, we were surprised and delighted by the visit, but at the same time, we were not adequately prepared to communicate with the visitors. This year we prepared better and offered visitors an animation - Frisbee golf, which is one of the activities in our Summer Park on Krvavec, new this season. Attendance at this year's fair was once again very good and certainly above average compared to other fairs we attend. We are also pleased with the response of visitors to the fair, as a number of them have already visited our park and redeemed benefits/prizes from our animation game from the fair. A big thank you to the organisers for listening and coordinating. <p/> Luka Vrančič RTC Krvavec, d.d.<p/> Today, we visited the Children's Bazaar at the Economic Exhibition Centre with the children from the Najdihojca kindergarten in Ljubljana (Butterflies and Magpies groups). We had a free guided tour of the fair. The tour guide was very nice and we must praise her for making a great effort. The Bazaar itself is interesting and offers a variety of activities for both young and old. Thank you on behalf of the children and staff of the Najdihojca Kindergarten, Thumbelina Unit - Butterflies and Magpies Group. We will come again. <p/> Najdihojca Kindergarten, Thumbelina Unit <p/> The future is in the hands of our children, let's make sure it is full of life, peace, happiness, beauty, joy of work and learning... We brought a piece of this idea to life at this year's Children's Bazaar. With our Montessori room and the Montessori materials and other developmentally-didactic toys presented, we wanted to add a touch of the importance of education. Visitors approached with great interest, with many questions, eager for information. The Montessori room was full of our little ones throughout the fair and surrounded by many observers, to whom we gave away great prizes. We are definitely still in touch with our visitors. <p/> Katarina Zver Belovič World of Children <p/> The large turnout at this year's Children's Bazaar event for families is a real confirmation that the organisers know how to listen to both children and parents. The pleasant and unobtrusive sales approach of the exhibitors, the educational activities and the charity campaigns provide a pleasant atmosphere for visitors and for us - the companies presenting our products or services. <p/> Tanja Pirc Podobnik Mercator d.d. <p/> Ljubljanske mlekarne has already presented itself at the Children's Bazaar several times. We have been developing the idea for the presentation ourselves over the years, but GR Engineering's support has always been welcome in its realisation. The team, which is competent in various areas (technical, communication, organisational, etc.), has always been there to help us achieve our goals. The Children's Bazaar is well organised and we will definitely be back again this year. <p/> Sara Wagner Ljubljanske mlekarne d.d. <p/> At the Children's Bazaar, which took place at the Gospodarské razstaviště Exhibition Centre, children from the Oton Župančič Kindergarten were given the opportunity to visit various exhibitions, and at the same time, they participated with their own items and also performed on stage. The professionals decided to take the children to the Children's Bazaar in the future, which offered a variety of activities for children. <p/> Ksenija Grabovica Assistant Director of the Otona Župančič Kindergarten <p/> The Children's Bazaar made a very positive impression on us, especially the freshness of the young families and their interest in experiencing nature and our ethnological workshops. <p/> Nives Brezovnik Rogatec Institute for Culture, Tourism and Development <p/> In 2010 we participated in the Children's Bazaar for the first time. The organisation of the event (exhibition spaces and assistance with their equipment, communication with the organisers, etc.) is at a very high level. The wide range of exhibitors and the free entry for visitors ensure that the attendance is really high. This gives exhibitors more than enough opportunities to showcase their products and activities.
__label__objective Frames for your posters <p/> There are a few things to keep in mind when ordering poster frames. We also need to consider where the frames and posters will be placed. If it is a marketing poster that will be installed outside, you need to be aware that it will be exposed to the weather. It is wise in this case to purchase waterproof frames so that the first storm does not destroy the posters, because in this case our efforts would be for nothing. The easiest way to find quality poster frames is online, as there are many quality manufacturers (3d art). Of course, it is always best to choose one where you can see at first glance a good price/quality ratio. Frames also differ in a few other ways, mainly in terms of where they will be hung. So you can choose from shop window frames, wall frames, hanging frames and, wouldn't you believe it, car frames. In fact, larger vehicles can be fitted with frames designed for marketing posters. Not only are frames made in traditional sizes, but you can also adjust the size of the frames to suit your needs and your poster format. Nowadays, it is well known that designers love to be creative and for creative posters you will also need creative frames. It is for the latter that some companies specialising in the production of marketing accessories will be able to help you and provide you with what you expect at the best prices. You should also consider that the frames will be functional and that you will be able to easily change the posters on display.

__label__subjective Racist assault <p/> Man charged with attempted murder for alleged self-defence <p/> Almonte, a Dominican, was in the wrong place at the wrong time on 26 March. Shortly before midnight, he was attacked by three shaved heads in the Domžale bar Pri Jurčku. It was allegedly a racist attack. According to the reader's testimony, the young men waited until the stranger was alone and then attacked him from behind. In order to defend himself against the kicks and punches, the attacked man crouched down and then swung a knife at the thugs. He cut two of them and ran away, but then surrendered to the police. <p/> Although this was a reaction in self-defence, the police then only charged the Dominican. Not those who allegedly "struck first". Since the end of March, Almonte has been in custody, which has already been extended once, as the court had to hear several witnesses and appoint a medical expert for three people, the Ljubljana District Court explained. The case file, which will be handed over to the prosecutor's office, accuses him of two counts of attempted manslaughter, which carries a sentence of five to 15 years in prison. After all the interrogations they have conducted, they believe that the Dominican man came after the Slovenians, not the other way around, and that he used the knife with the intention of killing them. But this is probably not the whole truth. The racist shaved heads allegedly threatened the witnesses of the incident: if they exposed themselves, they would retaliate, the reader wrote. The investigation therefore probably did not cover everyone who saw the incident. Only those who testified in defence of the attackers were exposed. We tried to verify this, but the court refused to grant us access to the file because the case is still pending. <p/> "I would like to point out that racism exists in this country and is a very serious problem. Intolerance is only escalating - to oppression, hostility, hate speech, physical violence. These things are very present and very dangerous and no one is doing anything about it," the reader wrote, further hammering on the conscience of eyewitnesses to overcome their fear and help the court get to the truth.

__label__objective Ljubljana, 28 November (STA) - The results show that a methodologically adjusted calculation would reduce the internal rate of return of Tesla 6 from 7.59% to 6.91%. Unsubstantiated assumptions allow risks to increase and, if they materialise, the rate could even fall to 5.12 percent, Geert Warringa of CE Delft said today at a presentation of the methodological flaws in the investment programme of Tesh 6. <p/> Such a rate of internal rate of return is far below the nine per cent required by the government in April as a condition for the state guarantee. "Therefore, the project should not have received state support in the form of a state guarantee," pointed out Lidija Živčič of Focus. <p/> The report states that there are some methodological errors in the investment calculations for the construction of the sixth unit of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant (Teš 6). Lignite prices are underestimated, lignite consumption is underestimated from 2028 onwards, and CO2 costs are underestimated because process emissions from desulphurisation plants, which will be auctioned after 2020, are not included. <p/> The programme also assumes that the efficiency of lignite extraction will increase, but this assumption is not justified, the report points out. The result would be undervalued lignite prices. Another unjustified assumption, according to the report, is that the peak electricity produced (1000 GWh) will always be in demand on the international market, Warringa noted. <p/> Ms Živčičeva noted that the report also states that the investment programme does not follow the principles of cost-benefit analysis because no realistic alternative for the investment is given. "The investment programme neither proves that the investment in unit 6 is the best alternative, which should be supported by a state guarantee and the risk should be borne by the state, nor that Teš 6 is the best alternative for energy supply in Slovenia," she said. <p/> Piotr Trzaskowski of the CEE Bankwatch Network pointed out that the involvement of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) in the project is not proof of a reliable economic assessment of the project. He warned that previous Slovenian governments had failed to do their homework and that if the project is granted a state guarantee for the EIB loan, Slovenian taxpayers will pay for their mistakes with their own money. <p/> "Now that new errors are being revealed in the calculations of the economic bases for Teš 6, the two public European banks have the opportunity to recognise their initial mistake and withdraw from this bad project while they still can. If we add to the errors identified in the report the errors in the procurement of Teš 6, we see that this project has the potential to cause serious damage to the reputation of the EBRD and the EIB," Trzaskowski stressed. <p/> The report was commissioned by the environmental organisations CEE Bankwatch Network and Focus, with financial support from the European Climate Foundation, and prepared by the Dutch consultancy CE Delft. <p/> The report will be sent to current and future parliamentarians and government representatives. <p/> The CE Delft report confirms that the Teš 6 project is "an economically misguided or unjustified investment", according to Zares Vice President Darja Radić, also a former Minister of the Economy. She recalled that, as a portfolio minister, she had proposed to the government to reject the state guarantee for Teš 6. Among other things, she had stated at the time that the project was economically too risky on key parameters - the price of coal, the price of CO2 credits, the size of the investment and the price of electricity. <p/> As Radićeva also wrote in a press release, the CE Delft report found methodological errors by the investment promoters on the first two parameters: the price of coal and the price of CO2 credits. They conclude that the coal price is underestimated and the cost of CO2 emissions is also underestimated.
__label__subjective It's like the Slovenian government without Dimitri Rupel, hehe. 1 I am writing this after watching yesterday's Trends. I stopped watching the show some time ago (mainly because of the lack of culture and unprofessional guests), but after a huge outpouring of black bile, I decided to watch it anyway to see where all the anger came from. Let me add my little finger to the debate for the time being. <p/> The point revolved around Michael Jarc, who wants to call a local referendum on the building of a mosque. I don't know the exact question (and, coyotes of journalism, they haven't published it anywhere - more proof of how much they care about the truth as long as it pops! ), but it seems to me that he doesn't want to completely block the building of a mosque, maybe just some minarets and/or accompanying sports facilities. This question has already been answered by the Constitutional Court, which ruled on a similar issue in 2004. At that time it stated: <p/> 35. From the foregoing it can be concluded that the objective pursued by the contested regulation is to restrict the right under Article 41(1) of the Constitution. However, such an objective is inadmissible in the light of Article 15(3) of the Constitution, according to which human rights may be restricted only for the sake of the rights of others (and in the cases provided for by this Constitution), because it is only for the purpose of restricting a right and not for the simultaneous protection of the rights of others. <p/> Therefore, paragraph 2 of the Decision calling the referendum is incompatible with the right to the free exercise of religion. Thus, the interference proves to be constitutionally impermissible already on the basis of an assessment under the so-called legitimacy test, and therefore the Constitutional Court did not need to engage in a further assessment of its excessiveness. <p/> So nothing will happen with the envisaged referendum. Although this did not stop Jelincic from (as always) starting a dispute 2 - although he then coldly told Becirovic to his face that he was a fool for equating him with Haider. The ever-noble Member is certainly as cunning as a pretzel, although the wiser ones are quick to overlook him. Once you have acquired some legal knowledge, he comes off as pathetic when he is clinging to the Slovenian Constitution and when he wants to lecture Mire Senica while the latter looks thoughtfully into the distance through the camera, inventing synonyms for his interlocutor in his head, without batting an eyelid. <p/> It seems to be popular lately for lawyers to engage pro bono only for cases that have the potential to be highly publicised in the media (Čeferin in Strojanovi PRESS) - lawyers are not allowed to (only) advertise. Andrej Saje also provided a newsflash bomb by saying that he wished the Islamic community all the best in the construction of their building, as he wanted everyone to have equal opportunities in terms of religion. OK, I guess we're not in the 14th century anymore and the Church has managed to civilise itself a bit and they're no longer impaling heretics on stakes or handing them over to the secular authorities to be cremated. But at least a little bit of rancour wouldn't hurt, no. At least a crude observation about the wrong God, pretty please? Well, it's not as if everyone is saying that the other side belongs to the wrong God and so, after taking all the creeds into account, we'll all be burned in Hell together. Or what? <p>Let us return to the mosque. As far as the morons have been and fallen out, everyone has one iota of a point. So, to combine them all into one (of) sentence. We definitely need a mosque. There is a good percentage of Muslims in Slovenia, and I do not see how it can benefit all of them to deny them a place to gather and a chance to practice their religion. We should not turn a blind eye - there are around 50 local places of worship in Slovenia, and the Orthodox faith also has its own church. The second issue is architectural. Very interestingly, Jelincic has pulled out a regulation from the naphthalene, which says that the building must be A metres away from the railway tracks 3. It must be appropriate to the surroundings or respect the architectural guidelines of the surroundings 4 As I am informed, the minaret is not compulsory, nor is the circular shape of the central building. I was also a bit disturbed by the picture showing a supposed mosque (although no tender/competition has yet been carried out), around which there is a hefty pile of sports and other facilities. It is true that they themselves know best what they need to carry out the precepts of their religion, and that even the Catholic Church has a house next door where ... er, well, yes ... religion takes place. However, the suggestion of tennis courts, a gym and a football pitch seems to me to be a bit of a stretch. After all, they (read the Arab Emirates) will be paying for everything themselves, so let them afford it if they can. <p/>After watching this, I'm not any more convinced that I'll start watching the Dren Dren Dren Dren Dren again, because they're on an even lower level than before. Uroš Slak really gives the impression that he only invites such guests autonomously for the sake of shouting, because when it flares up, he can't seem to extinguish it or turn the flow of the shouting conversation around. Apparently, they really cannot agree on anything or come to common conclusions, all that matters is the show, the shit and the stupidity. Anyway, I am in favour of the mosque (not exactly there and then and there, as they imagine in Trends, but let's wait for the actual tender) and I think that once it is built, there will finally be peace around this subject, which is being blown up to the proportions of a galaxy quite unnecessarily. So far, I have not seen anyone stoning a cuckolded man in an Orthodox church, or anyone burning down the home of a neighbour because he invites his friends to pray there. <p/> Or would you rather have a semi-stealing series called Brother to Brother, which costs EUR 1.5 million, and therefore we get True Reality cancelled because they cannot scratch together EUR 50 000? Although, somehow, it seems to me that this is more of an excuse to turn the national broadcaster into a brainwashing car wash, in the same way that it is now popular to lay off workers during a 'global crisis'. <p/> Anyway, every now and then I laugh at / marvel at the bizarreness of our professionals when they want to get into computing or the Internet - in today's case, it will be the legal profession. Sandra Cico, a lawyer, as a representative of the Association for the Protection of Audio-Visual Works, has sent the two sheets below to some (where is T-2, for example? ? ? ? ) Slovenian Internet access providers, demanding that they be blocked from accessing the torrent tracker PirateBay.org. It gives them 24 hours, then threatens them with legal and criminal proceedings. <p/> I understand the legal profession and the wishes of their clients, especially if one of them is about to receive a pile of money. However, this 'letter' is both legally and technically misguided. OK, they get the plaudits because they obviously know what an IP range is and what a tracker is, but for everything else I do not know whether to blame the ignorance of the law firm or the nepotism of Association 1. I would never dare to send such a request myself, even if local factors were very strong and very persistent. <p/> Banning the Internet, or parts of it, is ridiculous, impossible and slightly totalitarian. We all remember when udba.net hit - we streamed masses of scanned lists, searched there for our enemies and a few days later we were surprised by a fucking "blackout". Of course, the real geeks found themselves, and we grabbed some politically incorrect proxy and went back to the hilarious history of Danilo Potnik, Win Parachute and Ivan Janša. So the demand to ban a particular site is very ineffective, but it is also undemocratic - if memory serves, I pay for uninterrupted access to the entire web, if anyone has done anything illegal there, let them get on with it, leave the other users alone. <p/> The legal aspect can be problematic, especially because (as we are used to) the subject is not regulated with sufficient precision, let alone extensive case law. The requirement is interesting in its own way because it obliges Internet access providers to ban a site as if they had something to do with it (in Sweden, hello? ! ). The old Slovenian Penal Code knew a nice institution, cascading liability. It was really only for responsible editors, printers, etc., but we could follow that model. Of course, if the KZ-1 had not completely abolished cascading liability. Why? Well, the Minister's answer is as "convincing" as abolishing relative limitation periods. <p/> Liability on the Internet would go something like this: first, of course, the author, whose identification can become a whole project on the Internet, as there are plenty of tools for anonymisation. Second in line would be the webmaster. I'm not really talking about a webmaster per se, I'm thinking more of SiOL with its nest of blogs that anyone can open. If we couldn't get to that point, or if he was hiding in the Philippines, the domain owner would come into play, in very extreme cases of course. That is kind of where it all ends for my taste. It certainly ends with the Internet access providers, because, firstly, there is simply too much traffic for anyone to be able to monitor all their subscribers, and secondly, this requirement is absurd, because then, for example, all the providers in the world are responsible for the illegal streaming of copyright content via PirateBay, whose subscribers are, in a communist way, sharing games, music, programmes, porn amongst themselves. It is like the passengers on the trains in Madrid in 2004 suing the train company because a bomb was planted there by terrorists. The providers are just offering Internet access and there is no logic in having anything to do with something that someone creates and puts on a server at the other end of the Earth. <p/> Finally, a reflection for all the budding Slovenian pirates - THEIR responsibility in downloading illegal content from various trackers. Too many of them are brave, because so far there have been no serious / mass / high-profile police actions in Slovenia targeting anyone other than the traffickers, so they go around the forums shouting and beating their chests that nobody can do anything to them, while at the same time citing some EU directives and regulations. Let me disappoint you, oh, dear fellow-travellers. The Criminal Code (even the new one, strange that they have not abolished these things yet) knows about the infringement of copyright and other rights, which Sandra Cico already refers to - Articles 148 and 149 of the CC-1 are recommended reading. Add to that Article 38 - aiding and abetting (in the commission of a crime) and you have the perpetrator, streaming illegal content from the web. This applies to all "ordinary" pirates as well as to trackers (Filebits, Partis, Slobytes, etc.). This is really only a theoretical construct, and I cannot imagine Slovenian police officers and prosecutors looking at the troves of data on seized computers or 12 geeks sitting in court. After all, maybe we can look forward to live blogging, heh. <p/> As for these societies, it seems to me that we have quite a lot of them in Slovenia, although most of the time we don't hear anything intelligent from them, but it's more like air stirring. [ ] <p/> It is the title of a textbook on the Turkish invasions of Slovenian territory by Vasko Simoniti. And every time a multi-tourism kinastera comes to my mind, I start thinking about a topic related to culture. Today, I am going to get stuck into our beloved Slovenian language and spelling, or rather, into their squinting. <p/> Let's start with food. Hello. Olive oil. I have never heard a more butthurt word. Just as the oil itself became very fancy - almost art - when Jamie Oliver unhygienically poured it over arugula and parmesan. And it has also suddenly become artful to call it OIL. Let's go slowly: we know the tree that borders on the shrub, Olea europaea, that is, OLIVE. So, by induction, we find that the logical name for it is OLIVE fucking OIL. Mainly because it is the delicious olive that goes into the press, not just the tree - the olive. True, the SSKJ allows both terms, but olive is completely redundant. Especially since some SSKJ authors suggest the word crack for bun. Mhm. <p/>The other part, where there are untold problems, is the overlapping or, in the vernacular, umlauts. There are usually no peculiarities in the writing, except that the Council on Kanal A will apparently have to quickly upgrade the encoding to UTF-8 or change the font, because surnames with ü's are written as ue, although it is true that Slavoj Žižek is always left without a cross (above his head) abroad. It's the pronunciation that gets complicated. <p/> At the end of last year, we got a third President of the Republic, Danilo Türk, who won by a large margin. But even today there are some people (most of them in 24 hours on POP TV) who find it difficult to pucker their lips for the letter u and pronounce the letter i. All too often, however, they hear the disparaging Tirk; the unforgiving call him Turk (Zmago Padalec PRESS). Hans-Gert Pöttering, the current President of the European Parliament, is suffering a similar fate. He is most often rechristened Pottering or Petering. But it is the same, who would even bother! <p/> After a hard lesson, it is always good to relax / have fun, so take a look at how the new President Türk is perceived by the legends Ivan and Miro Serpentinšek, sorry, Serppentinschäck.

__label__subjective Psychotherapy for the challenges of (in)fertility <p/> Reproduction is understood as a fundamental feature of life that allows the existence and continuation of the species. Parenthood is also a natural part of the life cycle and an important milestone in a partnership. Both are taken for granted, not as something we want from life, but simply expect. <p/> Infertility is often one of the most emotionally challenging and stressful life experiences that an individual and a couple can experience. The struggle to conceive or the decision to adopt a child can often be accompanied by feelings of loss, which are often difficult to share with friends and family. For women who are struggling to conceive, it can be extremely painful to watch a friend preparing to give birth or young mothers she meets on the street. For men, it is common to feel sadness, helplessness and frustration that they cannot solve the problem and resolve their partner's pain. <p/> Infertility is a journey that is often accompanied by feelings of loneliness, sadness, helplessness and many frustrations. Even if it appears as a great unknown, fortunately there are well-established ways to get through this difficult period. Some experiences of infertility are common to everyone, others are specific to whether you have experienced pregnancy loss, failed IVF procedures, have not chosen to have an OBMP, are single, in a same-sex partnership, are considering donor sex, or are already parents and trying to conceive again.

__label__objective EVENING: A conversation with an ethical hacker <p/> 26 January 2015 Gregor Grosman, Večer <p/> Boštjan Špehonja is a hacker by profession, but he doesn't use his knowledge to cause harm, but offers it to companies for the benefit of discovering security holes and flaws. <p/> Hacking is done in agreement with the company, which also sets the rules for what the hacker can do and how far he can go, explains Boštjan Špehonja, who attended Unistar's RoglIT '15 conference as an independent expert. When conducting penetration tests, an ethical hacker avoids doing any harm, stealing data or deliberately disabling services, because we know that there are types of attacks that can temporarily disable a website. <p/> More vulnerabilities every day <p/> The fact that the number of intrusions is increasing does not mean that ethical hackers have more work to do. Špehonja explains that there is another constant here, as companies, both large and small, are not even aware yet of what data loss means in concrete terms. "There is a big step to be taken here to make companies more aware. There are more vulnerabilities every day, and if an administrator falls asleep, there's no need for anyone to go after that company specifically. There are Chinese, there are Pakistanis, there are Nigerians who automatically scan the internet, public IPs, all day long. As soon as they realise that a particular system is vulnerable, an automation is running in the background to exploit that vulnerability and cause your system to be used for further attacks to mask the real attacker." <p/> The problem lies in the belief of those in charge at many companies, who often wrongly assume that their data is of no interest to attackers. What is interesting are their computers, which hackers then exploit as bots for further attacks, explains Špehonja, who adds that while security starts with passwords, it is the human factor that he believes should be better educated in computer security. "Safe use of the Internet seems to be a given. This is why children in school and kindergarten are not given enough emphasis on safe use of the internet, and the trends of online scams and scammers are on the rise," he explains, adding that, after all, you can get one email, click on a link, open a little program, and you are already infected and can lose all your data or, in the worst case, even suffer financial damage. <p/> Don't use keys found on the ground <p/> In the case of attacks on large companies, such as the ones we have seen recently, these are well-planned attacks that take months to plan, and the attackers usually send an insider. Often the hackers' work is made easier by the "human factor", whether it is misconfigured fire security or users clicking on them, and often hackers leave USB sticks in car parks for example, which are then found and used by employees, even though, as the ethical hacker explains, the ISO 27001 security policy states that sticks found on the ground are not to be inserted into company computers. "These are all methods that are tested by attackers and sooner or later someone makes a mistake that opens the door to the company," concludes Špehonja. <p/> Anonymous well paid from behind the scenes <p/> When asked about the workings of Anonymous, the ethical hacker believes that it is a group that is well paid and run by someone, just like there are various viruses that are written specifically for the Middle East, which after seven years are found to have been funded by certain governments. "My personal opinion is that the main men are funded by a certain side to carry out certain attacks. Of course, this is also a trend among young people, to be Anonymous and to put a mask on Facebook. It's a subculture that is being exploited. Anonymous has a whole bunch of programmes of its own, but there is also a double-edged sword here. You decide as a teenager to be a member of Anonymous, you use their program, which really gives you some advantages, because they teach you how to "shekat" a certain thing, which you would otherwise also get on the Internet, but by doing that you put your computer at risk, because you don't know if that little program was clean and if maybe your computer is already in the process of being prepared for some DDoS attack that they are doing in the background," explains Špehonja. <p/> Hackers in movies and in reality <p/> The movie Hacker is currently playing in cinemas.Visualising an intrusion is always a particularly challenging task, often with user interfaces that are either very graphically sophisticated or a simple DOS window with opaque program code or numbers flying by extremely fast. Spehonja explains how far this is from reality by saying that "those numbers, those codes flying around, are usually laughed at by those of us who are in the field." The IP 352.612.x.x is nonsense, because there is no such thing as a number greater than 255. "As far as critical infrastructure is concerned, the degradation of water, transport infrastructure, electricity, etc. I would be careful what to say here, but it is also a possible attack. Of course it is possible, but of course it is more difficult. Such an attack would, of course, take a long time to prepare for, but the theoretical possibilities are there. After all, some people say that everything can be faked. Some people spend all day just writing programs that hack into other programs," adds the ethical hacker, who sees the movie scenes as being mostly exaggerated.

__label__subjective 5 reasons why coworking is a great solution <p/> In Slovenia, we have recently witnessed the rise of so-called coworking offices, which allow young entrepreneurs more flexibility than working in traditional offices, and are also more affordable, which is especially important for young companies. And they have many other advantages! <p/> 5 reasons why coworking is a great solution (Image source: sxc.hu) <p/> Coworking is a great solution for young businesses,... <p/> ... because you can separate work and family more easily. <p/> Many of today's very successful entrepreneurs have started their businesses in their own homes, whether in a dusty basement or in their living room. The fact is that young entrepreneurs start out with very limited funds, so renting their own office space is usually too expensive for them. <p/> This is why renting office space in a so-called coworking office, which is especially suitable for young companies with few team members, comes into play. These offices are much more affordable than traditional offices and allow the entrepreneur to easily separate home and office space. <p/> ... because you can build a real network of friends. <p/> Coworking offices bring together several entrepreneurial teams from very different business areas in one place. By renting office space in a coworking office, you will automatically become a member of the community and you will build a real network of friends. In this way, you will spread the word about your company and make new good friends. <p/> ... because doing business can be much faster and easier. <p/> Doing business in a coworking office is not only interesting and fun, it can also be much faster and easier. Need a programmer, a designer, an accountant? Don't worry, you'll probably find one in the next room, but if you can't find one, ask the other members of the coworking office for their contact numbers and recommendations, as they've probably used the services before. <p/> ... because working in an office is much more comfortable than working in a nearby pub. <p/> Laptops and almost unlimited access to the internet allow many entrepreneurs to work from different locations. One option that many people with space problems use is to work in a café with a cup of coffee or tea. The problem arises if the owners of the café do not approve of this and the entrepreneur has to leave the place... and let's not even waste words on the effectiveness of such work. <p/> You may be comfortable working from home, but your business partners or potential clients will be much more impressed if you meet them in a tidy office instead of in a room that is also your bedroom or kitchen. Prove to your clients and business partners that you are a serious person who does your job professionally.
__label__subjective In a logistic sense, a "rare disease" - e.g. operable childhood epilepsy - is an enormous challenge for the health service of a small country, which has to provide the highest quality treatment in centres that have the experience to do the job - and these can only be developed in settings with sufficient referrals, i.e. abroad. Slovenia is too small for it to be professionally and economically rational to develop specialised teams for all complex diagnostic procedures and surgical treatment of childhood epilepsy. The prerequisite of "at least 25 operations per year" (and, at the same time, a steady stream of intensive diagnostic treatments) is not achievable in such a small population, and we are therefore urgently dependent on collaborative action in international networks. Of course, if there is no national support for more enterprising ideas and real support for an organisation to disseminate its own knowledge and work for patients in a more grey region. Patients in the region are interested, they come to Slovenia for other opinions and advice. But it has long been the case that in Slovenia, the health policy has never supported the views of the Syrians, not even when it was about the big and world-renowned names (neurosurgery). Today, staffing is barely sufficient to prepare our patients, who are rightly sent abroad for further treatment. The profession has never had the support of management in this either. Where are we if we wanted to offer this to the wider region? <p/> It would be very wrong, in a time of 'austerity' in a time of global financial crisis, to start applying restrictions to those patients who are most vulnerable and in whom it is reasonable to expect a major improvement in health. It would be very wrong for the recently launched public debate (e.g. by Spomenka Hribar, certainly well intentioned) to be based on bad publicity. <p/> The fact that carefully selected children with epilepsy go for treatment to the best foreign centres is, in fact, also proof of the quality of our health care. Nasa's reflections on the theme 'to be or not to be ... an orphan' have also been well received in international circles, particularly in Scandinavia. Our proposal for targeted project work by small countries on this topic is being considered. <p/> prim Igor M Ravnik, Head of the Centre for Epilepsy in Children and Adolescents President, League Against Epilepsy Slovenia Ambassador of Epilepsy, International League Against Epilepsy
__label__subjective Irrelevant <p/> question always gets an answer ! <p/> 722 VIEW 0 COMMENTS <p/> All the consequences of wrong, untimely or indecisive decisions are ALWAYS the fault of the government that holds the reins, or in other words, has the scissors and the canvas. It is also responsible for the irresponsible work of the entire state and public sector, which, now that the crisis is over, should not bear the consequences for what it has caused. Once again, it will all burn on the little man, the lawless worker and the peasant. The cuts should therefore be made there, at home, not on the workers, the pensioners, the socially weak, and the lazy, the cunning, the liars and the prefrigid gypsies are being protected.

__label__objective Boris Pahor, writer, fellow-traveller and harsh critic of all three totalitarianisms of the 20th century, visited Kamnik <p/> Kamnik (4.5.2010) - Boris Pahor, writer, academic, Prešeren laureate, Knight of the French Legion of Honour, multiple Nobel Prize nominee, and recent recipient of Austria's highest state decoration, visited Kamnik today, where in front of a packed hall of the Kamnik Parent Library he spoke about his views on Slovenian society in the present and the past, both in his native Slovenia and abroad. His sparkling critical remarks touched everyone, regardless of political or ideological affiliation. In short, despite his 97 years, Boris Pahor is still at the centre of a critical shake-up of our society. <p/> VIDEO: Writer Boris Pahor thanks for the invitation to Kamnik and critically evaluates the arbitration agreement between Slovenia and Croatia. <p/> Short biography <p/> Boris Pahor was born in Trieste on 26 August 1913, and as a child of seven he witnessed the fascist burning of the Narodni dom (National Home), then the central institution of the Slovenes of Trieste, on 13 July 1920, and later witnessed the fascist persecution of the Slovenes, which led him to join the national liberation movement during the Second World War.<p/> Boris Pahor was born in Trieste on 26 August 1913, and as a child of seven he witnessed the Fascist burning of the Narodni dom (National Home), then the central institution of the Slovenes of Trieste, on 13 July 1920. In 1944, he was arrested and sent to the concentration camps of Dachau, Natzweiler-Struthof and Bergen-Belsen, which he survived with resilience and returned to Trieste after receiving treatment in a French sanatorium. After graduating from the University of Padua, he took a job as a teacher at the rebuilt Slovenian school in his hometown. <p/> Outline of his literary work <p/> Boris Pahor is considered one of Europe's best-known Slovenian writers.His works deal with the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps, often touch on the subject of the Slovenian minority in Italy and the suffering of the Slovenes of the Littoral region, and he is also known for his social and political engagement. Among his best-known works are the collection of novellas The City in the Bay and the novels Nomads without an Oasis, Clash with Spring and, above all, Necropolis, which has been translated into several European languages. Boris Pahor's literary works were re-evaluated only after Slovenia's independence, when he was awarded the Prešeren Prize and the Honorary Medal of Freedom of the Republic of Slovenia. To this day, however, the writer maintains a critical stance, for example in the controversy over the Italian Day of Remembrance for the post-war killings and the departure of Italians from Istria, accusing Italy of forgetting about fascism, while also criticising Slovenian restraint. <p/> The discussion with the writer Boris Pahor took place under the title "Witness to the past" and was moderated by the young writer Mitja Čander. <p/> Boris Pahor: "The minority should be united in its political speech" <p/> As a left-wing democrat, the writer Boris Pahor, together with the Catholic writer Alojz Rebula, laid the cultural foundations of the Slovenian minority in Italy after the Second World War. The renewed Slovenian cultural and political life encouraged Pahor to become involved in it by editing magazines such as Zaliv. Throughout, the writer from Trieste maintained a critical distance and view of Slovenian reality, defending his independence of thought, which naturally led him to clashes with the then dominant left-wing component in the Slovenian minority and with the new communist government in Slovenia. Although he himself was politically left-leaning, he never agreed with the position of Slovenians within the Italian left-wing parties, but instead advocated independent political action. <p/> Boris Pahor attracted a very diverse audience. Kamnik has not seen an event in a long time that brought together citizens of such different political and ideological persuasions. <p/> "The TIGR fighters were the first fighters against fascism" <p/> Boris Pahor stressed that the members of the TIGR organisation were the first to resist fascism. Their activities were multifaceted, including the collection of arms for a possible anti-Italian uprising in the event of an Italian attack on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Unlike the Communists, however, they were concerned to ensure that their actions caused as few casualties among the Slovene population as possible. When they killed one Italian in an action and this led to the Italians killing four Slovenes in revenge, they realised that such a struggle was not worthwhile. <p/> Pahor also pointed out that the post-war oblates refused to recognise the TIGR, and only recently has the TIGR been gaining ground again. Now, young people are also joining the organisation and are committed to the cause of slovakia. On the other hand, Pahor has repeatedly warned against the sale of Slovenian land in Primorska to the Italians, which would lead to the re-Italianisation of Primorska. He was also very critical of Ljubljana, or central Slovenia, which showed no great interest in Slovenians abroad. In Pahor's opinion, Slovenian school textbooks also do not sufficiently inform young people about the suffering of the Primorje people under fascism. Pahor is also against defending the struggle against the liberation movement as merely a struggle against communism. <p/> Matej Tonin listened attentively to Boris Pahor's thoughts. <p/> "Slovenia behaves towards its neighbours like a war loser" <p/> On the one hand, Boris Pahor also regrets the break-up of Yugoslavia, although he has never been against an independent Slovenian state. Slovenia's problem is that it does not have the same power as the former Yugoslavia, but our country's main problem is that it is too humble in its demands on its neighbours when it comes to asserting its national interests and protecting its national community. "Slovenia is behaving as if it had lost the war, not won it", Pahor added. <p/> Several books by Boris Pahor were also available for purchase in the foyer of the hall. <p/> "The post-war massacre of Home Army soldiers - a morally reprehensible act" <p/> Pahor took the former regime in the former Yugoslavia by storm with the publication of the booklet "Edvard Kocbek, a Witness of Our Time", which he and Alojz Rebula wrote in 1975 on the occasion of Kocbek's 70th birthday. In the accompanying interview, Kocbek spoke for the first time about the post-war massacre of returned Slovene Home Army soldiers, which raised a lot of dust, and Pahor was banned from entering the country by the Yugoslav communist authorities. <p/> For Boris Pahor, he is a victim, a victim no matter which political-ideological pole he comes from. That is why, despite the fact that he was taken to a German camp precisely because of his betrayal of the Home Army, he condemns the post-war killings of Home Army soldiers (around 10 000), because they were killings of unarmed prisoners of war. In this context, Boris Pahor advocated that the killings in the fojba, which in recent years have been exploited by Italian nationalists and even the highest representatives of the Italian state, should be placed in the broader context of events and it should be said that there were even bigger abysses in mainland Slovenia, where the communists after the war threw Slovenians - political opponents - and that the fojba should also be seen in the broader historical context of the suffering of the Slovenes of the Littoral region under fascist Italy since 1918 or, in other words, in the period of the Nazi occupation of the territory of the Littoral region. Italy, unlike Germany, which carried out a consistent denazification, did not carry out a de-Fascistisation. <p/> Boris Pahor: "Communism was a religion, even though it did not recognise God Stalin, in organising this "Communist Church", modelled himself on the institutional structure of the Catholic Church: with a Pope, cardinals, bishops and chaplains - of course, by other names.... There are 15 beasts in every man, and if a man lives in a totalitarian system, every such system acquires certain collaborators and believers who are ready to support it with all their being. This could explain the emergence of various leaders, e.g. in our case the "udbovtsy", who blindly trusted the Party and, like true believers, believed in communism, without giving a second thought to not deceiving their neighbours... Josip Broz Tito could be considered a criminal by many criteria, but he also has the merit of having Primorska annexed to Yugoslavia and Slovenia." <p/> Speaking of the Christian socialist Edvard Kocbek, whom he knew well, he said that communism should be realised in Slovenia, on the Christian-socialist foundations that Kocbek envisioned. But because the Slovenian communists had taken a different path, one that restricted freedom of thought and the individual, the communist model ended as it did in failure - and according to Pahor, communism as it was deserved it. <p/> In Pahor's view, Christians and parties that defend Christian values and the welfare state, like Krek and Kocbek, should also participate in any government. Only this, in Pahor's view, can lead to balanced development. <p/> However, the writer was also critical of Christians because, in his opinion, they put too much emphasis on wealth and appearances. In his opinion, it is difficult to become a good Christian from a Catholic ...
__label__subjective Publishing <p/> DI Kranjska Gora: Visiting elderly and sick members <p/> Chatting. <p/> In addition to these two names, the month of December, or December, has a championship in popular naming. To name but a few: Happy December, the craziest month, the month with the most lonely people, the month with the most holidays, the month with the millions of cards said, the month with the most goodies on the plates, the month with the craziest spending, the month of taking out loans for a few hours of crazy eating, the month of merchants, the month of children's joys, the month of mass temporary resettlement, the month of crazy behaviour, and I could go on and on. <p/> The purpose of my writing, however, is to shed some light on the designation, 'the month with the loneliest'. Why shine a light on something that is always more hidden than revealed? All our disabled people's associations are experiencing more and more members from the third age group. I am not saying that there is no loneliness in the younger groups of people, but it is clear that it is in the group of people in the third stage of life that there is the greatest loneliness. This is the generation that has already finished its working and creative task in life, has gone into the solitude of its retirement. <p/> The fallacy that everyone can hardly wait to retire is only true until you are about to leave your job for good and realise it. You have to leave the comrades who have kept you company for days and years, for better or for worse. The daily commute to work turns into looking out of the window and thinking how my comrades at work are doing. I count myself among the group that it took me two years to accept that I was no longer needed, that I was a tool that had outlived its usefulness. Even though I still had many social tasks and a lot of movement between people, it did not fill me up, so that I did not feel lonely and marginalised. Although I moved among the crowds, I always felt alone. I am not saying that this pattern applies to all of us who have retired, but I know that some of us felt marginalised, exploited in the workplace, and I know that they found it difficult to wait for the arrival of the last day at work. <p/> But this retirement has pushed the vast majority of people into isolation, at least temporarily, until they have found a job in some other area of society, and what if they have not? Usually these are the years when grandchildren come into the world, who somehow fill in society from work, but only temporarily. <p/> Filling time, which is too much at one time, can also lead to an incredible new burden of overwork and lack of time for oneself. This feeling leads to a new isolation, which makes one think that everyone has forgotten one's self and that one is just a tool of one's family or surroundings for as long as one is needed, and then one should get out from under one's feet for once. When, for many, there is the worm that sees that we are only waiting for our miserable end, loneliness reaches a peak that usually leads to a state of illness of mind and body, which is devastating for the individual. <p/> I myself am fortunate in that I am somehow still active in several areas, but it is also true that I always give myself just the right amount of time to myself so that I do not feel marginalised and lonely. But many times the thought creeps into my mind, yes, one day you will have to admit enough is enough, yes it is true, but I am pushing that thought into the future, when it will be, so why bother with it today. <p/> I am also fortunate to run a disabled people's association which employs me. Sometimes the work goes beyond what is reasonable, but that is only sometimes and when the state bureaucracy overreaches itself with tasks that benefit no one and we, through the associations, have to fulfil them. Running a society gives me the opportunity to chat with the membership more and more, which is like the salt of life. Chatting is usually a part or a courtesy of life when meeting people. If the main aim of chatting is to have a positive effect on the relationship and well-being of two or more people together, then I can say that chatting has an impact on the quality of the relationships between the membership. Chatting is typically a game of words. The basic rule of chatting is to strengthen mutual relations with elements of joking, fun, courtesy and to spend time together to avoid excruciating silence and to exchange different opinions on certain problems or events. Chatting has the aim of being friendly to other people and to the surroundings trapped in the same space. <p/> While chatting with the membership, I discover the phenomenon of loneliness of each member. Loneliness can be equated with talent, both components need to be discovered, neither is visible on its own. During December, this phenomenon is even more pronounced and killing. December is a month of anticipation, a month of planning a new path, a month of reckoning with the past tense, but also with the thought, everyone is going to have fun and rejoice, and it will be just me or myself for the holidays and the rejoicing. <p/> This thought leads many into a negative black mentality and even leads the slightly more unstable personalities into the thought of ending a sad life. In the Association we are aware of this situation of some of our members and we are working to raise awareness among the membership that loneliness and exclusion are most often caused by personal reflections and certainly not by social exclusion. <p/> In this month, which has only just begun, the Association of People with Disabilities of the municipality of Kranjska Gora has for years had a campaign to visit individual members who have been passive and more or less inactive over the year. The reason for the visit is usually justified by a small token of appreciation with a few sweets and a souvenir suitable for the December time. All this is cause for a short chat and a chat. <p/> Believe me, such a visit and a gift is the key that not only opens the front door of the home, it is also the key to the heart of the person being visited. A chat usually gives many answers which we had only suspected before. Whatever time our volunteers spend on such a visit, it always turns out in the end to have been too short and too measured. Usually, such a visit turns into indescribable happiness and joy, with the visitor realising that "I am not forgotten by everyone yet". I also take part in such visits as much as time permits and it fills me with a certain missing energy that I miss before such a visit, even though I am not even aware that I am missing it. <p/> The people who are visited are also aware of a certain helplessness and loneliness, but they do not know how to help themselves and get out of this cycle of loneliness. This is where our task as the leadership of the association comes in, to find the lonely members and help them to pierce the veil that keeps them in a certain vacuum of loneliness. This is what the mandatory seventh social programme, Preventing and alleviating the social and psychological consequences of disability, requires us to do. <p/> I dare say that we are an association with a good diversification of social work, but all the same we are left with a passive membership that cannot be animated into active membership. How to reach such a member and how to stimulate them is a Gordian knot whose shell we have not even raised, let alone broken. I am also aware that it will never be possible to raise everyone to the level of a working member. I am convinced, however, that we need to do more on this problem of inactivity and the results will come. Let me end my reflections with a greeting that is appropriate in these times, and I wish everyone good luck.

Since I have a garden, and since last year - as usual - the water ran out, and I intend to enlarge the garden this year, I had no choice but to buy this thing and get water for the rainy days. First of all, I was looking at flea cisterns. Then I sent out some enquiries for new cisterns. Finally, I found black tanks, the price was good, and I bought two. As the seller was willing to bring the two tanks to me, I squeezed his hand for another EUR 10 for the transport and the deal was done. Then the work began. <p/> On the first day we dug up one huge bush. We not only dug it up, we also broke it down into several smaller ones and on the second day we planted these smaller bushes by the road in another part of the garden. The next day we dug up the ornamental grass and planted it also in smaller pieces in another part of the garden (nothing goes away here). On the third day, we dug the soil for the trellis I had imagined. As the ground is uneven and I want the cisterns to be higher than the ground, they had to be raised. On the fourth day we made the trusses and then waited five days for 4 euros so that we could buy two knees for the gutter and finish the job. <p/> We waited five days for those 4 euros... :) You don't know whether to laugh or cry. On Tuesday I went to the ATM to see if by any chance any virtual money had come in, and yesterday when I checked again, it said that the card was blocked. Oops... the money was in the account, but how to get it and what happened on that night from Tuesday to Wednesday, I wondered. Lo and behold, the execution from Durs arrived. The contributions for the Social Insurance Institution, which I hadn't paid by the due date. I knew that would be the case, but I was kind of hoping that I would get the EUR 600 I had left (I had already paid EUR 700) before they remembered me. The important thing is that I paid the loan and that I still have some money left for the essentials, and the EUR 120 that the banks have charged me for the blocking, the execution and the costs, I will also have to swallow. In short, when I got the 4 euros, we could finish the job. Thank you... <p/> I know, yes, the plastic is not very pretty to look at, but I'm going to do some studying. First I need to see how the inox or whatever is around this plate heats up, then I'll either just cover the tanks with bamboo or plant some ivy around it. In any case, it will not stay as it is. Otherwise, I like it. The garden is right next door, the v-tank holds 1000 l, and the field is a little further on. It has to grow like a ludo, I would say.

__label__objective Baselines. Psychiatric patients, and especially alcoholics, are subject to stigmatisation, negative social perceptions and prejudices. The aim of our study was to examine the stigmatization and self-stigmatization of alcoholics in our cultural setting comparatively with regard to gender, alcohol consumption, alcoholic identity, age and educational structure. <p/>Methods. We used a semi-structured questionnaire with items related to different social perceptions regarding alcoholics. Respondents (n = 337) were sampled in an Alcoholism Treatment Dispensary and two general/family medicine outpatient clinics. Data were processed using t-test and factor analysis. <p/>Results. Women had more negative perceptions and more empathy towards alcoholics, men were more lenient and lacked empathy towards addicts, people with no identity as an alcoholic had more negative perceptions, both negative and positive perceptions loaded more with age, and both negative and positive perceptions loaded less and empathic perceptions of alcoholics loaded more with higher education. <p/>Conclusions. In our cultural environment, the stigmatization of alcoholics is very high and stronger than self-stigmatization. With higher education, it fades. Therapists involved in the treatment of alcoholics have had to revise our own perceptions of the stigmatisation of our patients, which will also influence our therapeutic approach. <p/>From social psychology comes the theoretical knowledge of implicit perceptions that we are rarely aware of, but which nevertheless have a profound influence on our behaviour and attitudes towards other people. Kelly observed that if we have dual information about people, we first follow our first impression and the information we have received from others. These perceptions give rise to prejudice, which is negative ideas about other people.1 The theory of social perceptions was pioneered by Moscovici in 1961.2 They represent the social knowledge of a group of people: a system of ideas, values and behavioural patterns that facilitates communication between members of the same group.3 Social perceptions are the basis for individual thinking and knowledge and are the result of an ongoing dialogue between members of the same group.4 They are the basis of attributions about how we understand other people's behaviour.5 Research on adult populations has pointed to three different conclusions about the stigma of mental disorders.6 The first is that people with mental disorders are more stigmatised than people with physical illnesses, and that those who abuse alcoholic beverages are more stigmatised than people with mental disorders. Another finding is that stereotypes associate mental disorders with irresponsibility and danger in individuals, leading to negative emotional reactions and discriminatory behaviour. The third finding is that personal knowledge of mentally disordered individuals reduces stigma. It also identifies discrimination due to self-stigmatisation.7 The character of the drinker is inferred from the drinker's behaviour under the influence of alcohol. The more he or she drinks, the stricter our judgement. Although we often stigmatise drinkers who drink larger quantities of alcoholic beverages, we often perceive them to be more cheerful. Our own drinking habits have a big influence on our judgement. Thus, heavy drinkers do not judge other drinkers as strongly as moderate drinkers or teetotalers.8 The aim of the present study is to determine social perceptions of alcoholics both in the general population and among alcoholics, and to identify differences in perceptions according to drinking patterns, age, gender and education. Our working hypotheses were that self-stigmatisation of alcoholics is greater than that of non-problem drinkers and that stigmatisation by relatives is milder than that by those who have no experience of living with an alcoholic. <p/> Methods <p/> Sample <p/> A questionnaire was distributed to patients in three outpatient clinics. The first group of patients was a group of alcohol-dependent patients and their relatives who are under treatment in the Dispensary for the Treatment of Alcoholism and Other Addictions at the Dr. Adolf Drolc Health Centre in Maribor. The other two groups of patients were sampled consecutively in two general medicine outpatient clinics from the same health centre. One outpatient clinic was selected in the city centre, the other in Lovrenec na Pohorju. In total, 337 completed questionnaires were obtained. 149 men and 188 women completed them. The whole sample was divided several times into several subgroups, which were then compared with each other. 146 of them had the experience of living with a person who is dependent on alcohol. 60 were alcohol dependent and 49 were alcohol abusers. In terms of educational structure, most of them had a vocational education (71 or 21.1%), a secondary education (88 or 26%) and a higher education (98 or 29.1%). The mean age of the subjects was 41.4 years + 13.9 years. The group sampled at the Alcoholism and Other Drug Treatment Dispensary included 11 alcoholics who had been in treatment for less than six months and 31 who had been in treatment for six months or more. The results of their relatives' group were added to a group of people from the general population who answered yes to the question whether anyone in their family was a frequent drinker. <p/> Instrument <p/> Description of the instrument <p/> We constructed an instrument containing independent variables (sex, age, education, family history of binge drinking, whether someone is a recovering alcoholic), 44 items relating to perceptions of alcohol dependence (a five-point scale of agreement), three open-ended statements to be completed (a test of incomplete sentences), and six questions testing attitudes towards drinking. The instrument is reproduced in full in the Annex. <p/> Validity and reliability <p/> The rational validity of the questionnaire was obtained on account of the broad coverage of views (interviewing professionals involved in the treatment of alcohol dependence, interviewing alcohol dependents and people in frequent contact with alcohol dependents [ waitresses ]), the theoretical background on stigmatisation and self-stigmatisation of addicts6-8 and the three experts who analysed the individual items. Factor analysis was used for empirical validity. We extracted five factors which explain 45.14% of the variance. Factor 1 - " Factor of strongly negative attitudes " explains 19.16% of the variance, Factor 2 - " Factor of positive attitudes " explains 9.50% of the variance, Factor 3 - " Factor of empathy towards alcoholics " explains 7.27% of the variance, Factor 4 - " Factor of empathic attitude " explains 5.24% of the variance, and Factor 5 - " Factor of personal accountability and negative perceptions " explains 3.99% of the variance. External validity was not established because we did not have a pre-existing instrument measuring attitudes towards alcohol dependence. Reliability analysis was carried out using Crombach's coefficient a. This was 0.859, indicating exemplary reliability.9 Item-by-item reliability analysis was also carried out. We found that the reliability of the instrument could have been improved slightly if five items had been dropped, but we decided to keep them as they were items relating to empathy, which was of interest to us in the study. On a smaller sample (n = 20), we further tested the reliability by means of a test-retest method and checked for correlation. <p/> Statistical analysis <p/> Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS-11.5 and SPSS-13.0 statistical packages. We were interested in statistically significant differences between the independent variables, considering significant differences at p &lt; 0.05. Comparisons were made using t-test for independent samples and analysis of variance. Factor analysis was also performed. We used the Principal Axis Factoring (PAF) method and the Oblimin oblique rotation method. <p/> Results <p/> Comparison of item differences by gender <p/> Statistically significant differences were found for as many as 20 social perceptions. In the whole sample, women gave more value to negative perceptions (destroying families, aggressive, annoying, would betray and sell everything for alcohol), more to empathic perceptions (seeking oblivion and comfort, not finding their own way out of a crisis, not being able to heal themselves), and a difference was also found for the item preferring to avoid it. Men in the whole sample gave more value to performances from which a defensive attitude could be seen (everyone has some form of addiction, everyone has a reason to get drunk, alcoholics are promiscuous as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they make me feel good about myself, they are cheerful, they put me in a good mood, I prefer an alcoholic to a teetotaler), on the other hand, men are less empathetic (I don't care about them, they should pay more for health insurance, an alcoholic is converted when he rolls in a pit), they are more likely to be labelled "losers", they are more likely to see alcoholism as a hereditary disease, and they are more likely to prefer an alcoholic to a teetotaler than women. <p/> Differences are present for only two items in the whole sample. Alcoholics are preferred by those without experience of living with an alcoholic, and those with experience place more value on the notion that alcoholism is a genetically determined, hereditary disease. <p/> Comparison of item differences according to the rating of being harmful or dependent on alcohol <p/> Differences between these two subgroups of the total sample are present for eight items. People who drink harmfully were more likely to describe alcoholics negatively than alcoholics themselves (they use alcohol as an excuse to fail, they are unreliable, calculating and exploitative), they have no empathy for alcoholics (they don't care about them, they should pay more for health insurance), even though they prefer an alcoholic to a teetotaler (they do not care about them, they should pay more for health insurance). Alcohol-dependent people gave more value to the item that it makes them feel bad to see others making fun of alcoholics and that alcoholics feel guilty about their own dependence. <p/> Comparison of item differences on problem drinking <p/> Differences between the subgroups of the full sample are present for nine items. People who were harmful or dependent on alcohol gave higher scores to items that showed leniency towards the dependent and a defensive attitude (everyone has a reason to drink as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they are happy, they put me in a good mood, they make me feel good about myself, everyone has some form of dependence, alcohol is a hereditary disease). People without a problematic attitude towards drinking gave higher value to two items (they are bad guys and I prefer to avoid it). <p/> Comparison of item differences according to the presence of an alcoholic identity <p/> Differences are present for six items. People in the treatment programme with an alcoholic identity gave higher values to items with an empathic perception of alcoholics (they have feelings of guilt, it makes me feel bad when others make fun of them) and to the item that alcoholism is a hereditary disease, while people without this identity gave higher values to items with a negative label (they are unreliable, calculating and exploitative, they use alcohol as an excuse to fail). <p/> Comparison of item differences by age <p/> The total sample was divided into three groups: young people up to 29 years (n = 74), people between 30 and 59 years (n = 220) and people aged 60 and over (n = 39). There was a statistically significant difference for 12 items. For the six items with negative social perceptions (they are wrinkles, they are calculating and exploitative, they are violent and arrogant, they are weak, neglectful and intrusive, and they don't care), the value of the items increases with age everywhere. The three items with positive perceptions (as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they are cheerful, they make me feel good about myself) have the same trend of increasing value with increasing age. Similarly with the item "I don't care about them". The item that alcoholism is a response to inner distress was given the highest values by middle-aged people and the lowest values by the oldest generations. For the item that alcoholism is a hereditary disease, the highest values were given by the oldest and the lowest by the youngest people. <p/> Comparison of item differences by education <p/> The educational structure of the total sample was divided into three groups: people with incomplete, completed primary school and vocational secondary school (n = 107), people with completed secondary school (n = 88) and people with completed higher and university education (n = 128). Statistically significant differences are present for 22 items. All negative perceptions (they are wrinkles, they are annoying and disrespectful, they are calculating and exploitative, they are violent and arrogant, they allow themselves too much, they should be treated against their will, they are neglectful, they are disruptive and pushy, alcoholics are promiscuous, they don't care, they are guilty of addiction themselves) are lower in people with higher education and highest in people with the lowest education. Similarly, positive perceptions (everyone has a reason to get drunk as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they are happy, I prefer an alcoholic to a teetotaler, they give me a sense of self-satisfaction, everyone has some form of addiction). Items expressing empathy (I feel sorry for them, I feel bad when others make fun of them) have the reverse trend - higher values at higher education levels. "I don't care about them" has the highest weighting for the lowest educated and the lowest for the highest educated. "Alcoholism is a hereditary disease" has the highest value in the lowest educated group. <p/> Fig. 1. Differences on the first factor between the subgroup of alcoholics in treatment for less than 6 months (SOA &lt; 6 months), alcoholics in treatment for more than 6 months (SOA &gt; 6 months) and the group of people with no alcoholic identity (control group). <p/>Factor analysis of the sample <p/>The value of the Keiser-Meyer-Olkin test of sample adequacy (0.828) and the result of the Bartlett test (p = 0.000) indicate that there is a significant association between the variables. Five factors were taken into account, together explaining 45.2% of the variance. The first factor explains 19.2% of the variance. It is occupied by strongly negative social perceptions (they are disruptive and intrusive, violent and arrogant, neglectful, annoying and disrespectful, calculating and exploitative, they are wrinkles, they do not care, alcoholics are promiscuous, they would sell and betray everything, they are bad people, they should be treated against their will and they should pay more for health insurance). The second factor explains 9.5% of the variance and is occupied by positive perceptions of alcoholics (they are happy as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they give me a sense of satisfaction with myself, I prefer them to teetotalers and everyone has a reason to get drunk). The third factor (7.3% of the variance) is occupied by the items of empathic attitudes towards alcoholics (alcoholism is a response to inner distress, I feel bad when others make fun of them, they are victims of childhood, they pity me, they cannot find their own way out of the crisis, they cannot cure themselves, they have feelings of guilt about their addiction). The fourth factor (5.2% of the variance) is occupied by the empathic attitude items, which have a negative loading, which can be understood as a refusal to establish an empathic relationship with them (they feel that nobody likes them, that they are looked down upon, that everybody hates them, they seek oblivion and comfort in alcohol). The fifth factor (4.0% of the variance) is occupied by two negative items that are not as negatively emotionally charged as the items in the first factor (they destroy families, they are unreliable) and two items that attribute personal responsibility for the onset of dependence. Again, there were differences between the groups. Women significantly loaded more heavily on the first factor than men (p = 0.000), similarly, people who abuse alcoholic beverages loaded more heavily on the first factor than alcoholics (p = 0.047), and people with a problematic drinking pattern loaded more heavily on the second factor than people with a neutral attitude towards drinking. The unstructured part of the questionnaire asked for three follow-up thoughts. The first was: ' When I think of a person who is dependent on alcohol, I think of... ", the second: " When I think of a person dependent on alcohol, I feel ...". and the third: " If the alcohol-dependent person were my son, I would ...". The first question was most frequently answered with family in 15, the second with sadness (11.6), fear (9.2), anxiety (8.3), sympathy (7.1%) and anger (6.5%), and the third with motivation for treatment (37.4%) and help (24.3%). The only statistically significant difference between these responses was in the second thought, where women were more likely to respond that they felt fear in themselves when they were with an alcoholic (p = 0.048). <p/> Discussion <p/> We found many statistically significant differences between the samples, but unfortunately we cannot discuss all of them here. Therefore, we will only highlight the most pronounced and surprising ones. Our hypothesis that the self-stigmatisation of alcoholics is greater than the stigmatisation of people who are not problem drinkers has been shown to be false. It was influenced by our own narrow social perceptions, when the authors, as therapists in constant contact with sober alcoholics in the therapeutic process, seemed to have gradually lost our own prejudices against these people and inferred from them the perceptions of the general population. Thus, people who harm alcoholics label alcoholics more negatively and lack empathy towards them, which is understood as using their own defences in terms of projection and denial. They see in addicts their own path to alcoholism, their own projection into a future that they hate because they feel powerless to change that path. When they evaluate them, they are in a sense evaluating themselves. However, they, along with the addicts, still showed more leniency towards the alcohol-dependent than people with a neutral attitude towards alcohol, and they were significantly more likely to label alcoholics as bad guys. There was an even clearer difference between people with an alcoholic identity and those without. The former showed much more empathy towards alcoholics, while those without showed significantly more negative social perceptions and prejudices. Factor analysis confirmed these results. People who abuse alcoholic beverages loaded more heavily on the factor with negative items than alcoholics, and the same for women, among whom there is less problematic consumption of alcoholic beverages. On the other hand, people with a problematic attitude towards alcohol loaded more heavily on the factor with positive items than people without a drinking problem. An interesting result is provided by comparing people with an alcoholic identity: those in treatment for up to six months and those in treatment for more than six months. The former significantly loaded more heavily on the first factor than the latter, indicating the influence of the treatment process in terms of alleviating prejudice and abandoning defensive attitudes: by accepting the identity of a treated alcoholic, they have less need to project negative self-images onto "other" alcoholics. Our second hypothesis was that relatives would have fewer prejudices against alcoholics than people without this experience. This hypothesis also proved to have no real basis in the sample comparison. The only differences between the two samples were that people without this experience prefer to avoid alcoholics rather than those with it, as evidenced by the sad experience in our Alcoholism Treatment Dispensary of seeing patients who repeat over and over again the well-established, albeit highly pathological and painful, life experiences of living with alcoholics, and that relatives of alcoholics are more likely to see alcoholism as a hereditary disease compared to people without this experience. This difference is probably due to the fact that many of the relatives have been involved in our treatment programmes and that many of the alcoholics in our programmes have had an alcoholic as a relative, so that through the education of the addicts and their relatives, this perception has settled in. The gender differences were interesting. On the one hand, women were typically more likely to have negative social perceptions of alcoholics, but at the same time showed more empathic perceptions towards them. The first part can be understood as a consequence of the fact that women are less likely to be alcohol dependent than men,10 which confirms the aforementioned fact that our hypothesis of greater self-stigmatisation was not supported by the evidence. The second part can be seen as a consequence of women's greater social orientation towards empathic perception of other people.11 For men, the responses were in the opposite direction: they showed a greater defensiveness towards (their own) addiction and a lack of empathic perception of alcoholics. Here we also encounter gendered social perceptions of how alcohol consumption is perceived by men and women, what are acceptable levels and forms of drunkenness. And here we meet strict women, guardians of the family order, peace and the nest, guardians of the circumstances in which children grow up and of family traditions. It is no coincidence that, alongside priests, teachers and doctors, it is women who have helped to build the anti-alcohol movement so enthusiastically, and who have constituted the majority of the membership of these movements.12, 13 Differences according to age have shown a trend towards increasing negative perceptions and prejudices, as well as positive perceptions of alcoholics, with a pronounced defensiveness. It can be concluded that at a younger age attitudes towards alcohol consumption are still relatively neutral, but as the years go by, due to the gradual accumulation of personal experience, more extreme views on addiction grow, both condemnation on the one hand and greater tolerance due to, we assume, a more defensive attitude due to one's own problematic attitude towards alcoholic beverages. Part of these differences can probably be attributed to the fact that first contact with alcoholic beverages is associated with a number of positive effects (validation and acceptance in the society of young people, alcohol as a help and as an alibi for social inadequacies). Negative social perceptions and prejudices correlate even more strongly with educational structure: negative perceptions are highest in the lowest educated group, but so are positive perceptions, presumably due to a higher level of own problematic attitudes towards drinking (alcoholics from the same background have a lower educational level than people from the general population14). On the other hand, higher educated people have a higher level of empathic perception of addicts. <p/> Annex: Questionnaire on perceptions of alcohol dependence <p/> Gender <p/> Age <p/> years. <p/> Education: <p/> incomplete primary school, primary school, vocational secondary school, secondary school, college, university. <p/> On a scale of 1 to 5, please indicate the number that best corresponds to your feelings: <p/> 1 - do not agree at all, 5 - strongly agree. <p/> 1. <p/> Everyone has a reason for getting drunk: social worries, work, family. <p/> 1 <p/> 2 <p/> 3 <p/> YES <p/> NO <p/> - <p/> Do you drink alcoholic beverages practically every day? <p/> YES <p/> NO <p/> Conclusions <p/> Our research has shown an alarming stigmatisation of alcoholics in our cultural environment. Thus, the factor with the highest factor loadings was the factor with negative perceptions of alcoholics, which explained 19.2% of the variance in the factor analysis. Otherwise, the study pointed to large gender, age and educational differences, which we had not expected. Thus, the authors were forced to change our own perceptions of how the wider social environment views alcoholism and the alcoholic. We believed that the environment was much more accepting of alcoholics and often interpreted alcoholics' fear of stigmatisation as an application of their own projections. We have now found that alcoholics' fears of wider social stigma are justified. Especially in the segment of the less educated and women. At this point, we can pause to ask whether the task of therapists working on alcohol dependence is also to change social perceptions of alcoholism. Where there is a lack of knowledge and knowledge, there is room for prejudice and stigmatisation, which is a natural social process. By changing social perceptions and destigmatisation, the authors suggest, social rehabilitation of alcoholics will have greater success and the prognosis for abstinence will be better. Because at present, sober alcoholics are generally more stigmatised after treatment than drunk alcoholics without an alcoholic identity.
__label__subjective The top 10 family-friendly holidays in Europe <p/> Little wanderers are missing something <p/> Do you agree with Tripadvisor's ranking? Little Tramps would add to it: <p/> Tuscany (Italy) <p/> Sicily (Italy) <p/> Valencia (Spain) <p/> Wondering why? Because the walk around the capital is beautiful and the view from the top is uuuuaaaaaauuuuu. Because the little wanderers have a lot to run, skip, climb up the narrow stairs, look through the lino, imagine how they used to defend themselves from here. Because the collection of weapons just fascinates them. Because they would listen and listen to the mixing of Russian and Italian. Because they themselves have small cars and interesting number plates. Because you will be wandering around with your loved ones. Because there are so many more reasons that you have to discover for yourself and make your own memories. And because San Marino is relatively close, just 510 km from Ljubljana, which is less than 5 hours' drive. It's also close to the Adriatic Sea, with its kilometres of coastline and many tourist towns that invite us to soak up the sun, jump in the sea and enjoy a homemade ice cream. So don't just make it a day trip, make it a multi-day holiday. <p/> Some people say they are in love with Tuscany. Picturesque hills and valleys with vineyards, olive trees and sunflowers. Its proximity makes it even more interesting for Slovenians, as we can go there practically at any time. 4-5 hours and we are there. <p/> There are 6 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Tuscany: the historic centre of Florence, the historic centre of Siena, the square of Pisa Cathedral, the historic centre of San Gimignano, the historic centre of Pienza and Val d'Orcia. <p/> Venice has always been known as the city of a hundred canals and bridges. In the city, the visitor will not find a single road or vehicle as we are used to on the mainland. From the beginning, the rich merchants and nobles of Venice have been transported by gondolas. Today, the gondola is renowned as the most romantic means of transport. Children will also find the boats in Venice most interesting. <p/> If you're up for exploring the big city, then you can certainly take your child to London. The city offers many attractions that are also interesting for children. If flying there on low-cost carriers is very cheap, you will pay a bit more for accommodation (cheap accommodation can be found here too, if you are not demanding), but above all for entrance fees, which are certainly not cheap.
__label__objective President Pahor at investment conference in Istanbul: "Slovenia is important for Turkey and Turkey is important for Slovenia" <p/> Today, at the end of his official visit to the Republic of Turkey, the President of the Republic of Slovenia, Borut Pahor, attended an investment conference aimed at further promoting the Slovenian economy and presenting current investment opportunities in Slovenia. In addition to the President of the Republic of Slovenia, Mr Borut Pahor, important Turkish investors were also addressed by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Karl Erjavec, State Secretary of the Ministry of Finance Mitja Mavko, a representative of the Slovenian Compensation Insurance Company and the Director of Spirit Boštjan Skalar. In his opening remarks, the President of the Republic stressed that Turkey and Slovenia have a long-standing friendship and respect, which is also very important for economic cooperation on both sides. He described Turkey's goal of becoming one of the ten strongest economies in the world in the next 10 years as inspiring and admirable. "Turkey is of strategic importance for Slovenia and we need to strengthen cooperation at all levels. Slovenia is important for Turkey and Turkey is important for Slovenia," the President said. Addressing more than 80 Turkish investors, President Pahor presented Slovenia as a dynamic, open and export-oriented country and invited potential investors to come to Slovenia. He highlighted Slovenia's human potential and its exceptional geopolitical position as a meeting point between Central and South-Eastern Europe. In this context, he recalled that he and President Gül had agreed at their meeting yesterday on the utmost importance of the Brdo Process initiative for the stability of the Western Balkans. There are many opportunities for strategic investment in Slovenia, President Pahor said, underlining that Slovenia is very interesting for Turkey, as the two countries have well-regulated contractual relations and have concluded all the most important agreements in practically all areas of common interest. Among the most important of these is the Strategic Partnership Agreement. Yesterday afternoon, the President attended the 6th Annual Conference of Ambassadors of the Republic of Turkey, where he gave a short lecture. After the lecture, the President also met with the Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, Mr Ali Babacan. Late yesterday afternoon, President Pahor met with the Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. During their talks, President Pahor and Mr Erdoğan noted that the effects of the strategic partnership signed two years ago are already visible and committed to further cooperation. Prime Minister Erdoğan welcomed President Pahor's willingness to open an investment conference in Istanbul today to present concrete opportunities for Turkish investors to invest in Slovenian companies, for more vibrant cooperation between the economies of the two countries, and for a possible joint appearance on third markets. The two also discussed some aspects of the Syrian crisis, which has led to over 600,000 refugees fleeing to Turkey in recent months. In this context, Mr Erdoğan outlined his views on stopping the armed conflict in the light of the forthcoming Geneva 2 meeting, as without immediate action the conflict could take on wider regional dimensions. <p/> Search <p/> Contact
__label__objective Risi to Korea next year <p/> The Slovenian national ice hockey team will play next year in Division I, Group A, and the championship will take place in Seoul, South Korea, from 20-26 April 2014. <p/> At the IIHF Congress, which is currently taking place in Stockholm, the hockey federations playing in Division I, Group A confirmed the only candidate to host the IIHF World Championship Div I/A, the Republic of South Korea. <p/> Four participants were ineligible: Austria and Slovenia because they were relegated from a higher group, Ukraine because it has yet to qualify, and Hungary, which hosted the championship this year (under the rules, the same country cannot host the championship twice in a row unless there is no other candidate). <p/> The date of the Championships will be confirmed within 10 days, as Slovenia and Austria have proposed a later date than the one proposed by the organiser. We told the congress that both federations are participating in the Olympics, which means that we will also have to postpone the joint leagues (INL and EBEL) by at least 3 weeks. <p/> The proposal from Slovenia, Austria and Hungary (participating in EBEL) was a week between 26 April and 2 May, and the date was confirmed as appropriate by IIHF Sport Director Dave Fitzpatrick, as the condition that Division I is finished one week before the start of the Elite Division WC (which starts next year on 9 May) is fulfilled. The date has not been officially confirmed as the Japanese federation cannot confirm a date change without the agreement of the home league management. <p/> Therefore, the IIHF proposed a deadline for a decision - within ten days. <p/> Delegates at the IIHF Congress confirmed Germany and France as hosts of the 2017 IIHF Elite Division World Championship by 63 votes in favour. The other candidates, Denmark-Latvia, received 45 votes. <p/> UPDATE: <p/> On 29 May 2013, the Korea Hockey Federation, organiser of the next Ice Hockey World Championship, Division IA, announced the final date of the championship: the Div IA Championship will take place from 20-26 April 2014 in Seoul. <p/>Poll
__label__objective From now on, partnership farming also in Styria <p/> First distribution of organic produce baskets between farmers and consumers on Thursday, 12 May 2011 <p/> From tomorrow, consumers in Maribor will also be able to access organically produced food through the partnership farming system in the form of vegetable, fruit and cereal baskets. The first distribution of vegetable and cereal baskets will start on Thursday, 12 May 2011, at 17:00 in the courtyard of the Biotikva farm in Limbuš near Maribor (Lackova cesta 267, 2341 Limbuš). At the end of May, the participating farmers will further expand their offer of vegetable baskets and will also offer fruit baskets to consumers. <p/> The ECHo association, which initiated and organises this project in Styria and Prekmurje, is pleased with the current response. 7 organic farms have joined the partnership and will provide consumers with weekly vegetable, fruit and cereal baskets, as well as other products from organic production and processing: spreads, juices, jams, bread, eggs, meat and dairy products. 34 consumers have chosen to buy organic food in the context of partner farming. This is the first attempt of this kind of sales between organic farmers and consumers without intermediaries in this part of Slovenia. With this project, the association wants to promote the development of organic farming among farmers and to support organic farmers. <p/> What is partnership farming? <p/> Partnership farming is a new way of linking farmers and consumers in Slovenia. Different models (CSA - Community Supported Agriculture) have proliferated around the world, but they have a common denominator: they promote local, sustainable and ethical consumerism, with a special emphasis on solidarity among small farmers who farm without synthetic fertilisers and sprays. Typically, it is one farmer or a group of farmers who sell their produce to 20 to 30 customers. Before the sowing season, the farmer talks to the consumers about their wishes, clear rules are agreed, then the farmer sows the area and supplies the crops according to organic production technology and regulations. The produce grown on the agreed area is distributed weekly to the consumers. <p/> Once consumers have opted in, they meet the farmer and other consumers each week at an agreed date, time and location to collect their basket. They can also exchange produce and products with each other. In this way, the farmer supplies his consumers every week throughout the year with organic food that is truly fresh and has a very short transport route from the field to the plate. This way, the consumer knows exactly who grows their food, where and how. Consumers receive high quality organic food and the farmer is able to live with dignity as a result of this cooperation.
__label__subjective News <p/> Smashing coconuts to get your rights <p/> Professional footballers in Poland have come up with an ingenious idea to fight for their rights after some clubs started bullying them and forcing them to train on their own due to their disagreement with the terms of their new contracts and their subsequent refusal to sign them. They are smashing coconuts. The most recent and perhaps most noteworthy case is that of Slask Wrocław, which imposed a cruel 14-hour working day on striker Sebin Plak for six months after he refused to sign a new contract with more than half the amount. "The club's management did everything to destroy me mentally," said Plaku. Such behaviour by clubs is common in Poland and these clubs have been given their own name in football circles, the "Coconut Clubs". They were named after Daniel "Kokos" Kokosinski, who was mistreated, bullied and harassed by Polonia Warsaw FC in 2009. As part of a campaign launched by the Polish Professional Footballers' Union PZP to mark these events, players from the second division club Olimpia Grudziaz gathered in the changing room and shouted 'let's smash the coconut' in one voice, which was then smashed with a hammer a few moments later. Lukasz Surma, who has more than 500 appearances in the Polish first league, joined the second division players on the occasion. Here you can watch a video of the players smashing coconuts in protest. <p/> Other news

__label__objective Coats of arms in the Chapel of St George at Ljubljana Castle <p/> 17.09.10 Author: Aleksander Hribovšek <p/> The Chapel of St George at Ljubljana Castle is the only major architectural monument in Slovenia that is decorated with coats of arms and commemorates the former regency. Its present appearance shows the most important architectural elements of its Gothic base and Baroque superstructure. The history of the construction reveals two layers of time. The first dates back to 1489, when Emperor Frederick III established a benefice at the castle in honour of St George, St Pancras and St Helena, and the second to the additions made after 1616. The exact year of the beginning of the construction is not known, but it was certainly built before the foundation of the benefice. <p/> The castle chapel is mainly decorated with the coats of arms of the governors of Carniola who served in Ljubljana from 1261 to 1742. They were painted by Abraham Kaltschmied, a copper-engraver, draughtsman and engineering lieutenant at the time, when Count Corbinian of Saurauški was the head of the provincial Estates. The regional governors were the chiefs of the land, alongside the Emperor, the supreme ruler. They were at the head of the Land Estates and the Land Administration. They were appointed by the rulers on the proposal of the provincial Estates. The governor administered the land and was the supreme judge, taking orders from the ruler and presiding over the provincial assemblies. Initially, he was the king's deputy, but during the interregnum he was deputy to the various rulers who briefly held the land. The Habsburgs retained the office of governor, who became deputy to the Prince of the Land and commander of the Land's army, as well as president of the Land's Diet. <p/> The coats of arms in the chapel can be divided into three groups: on the north, west and south walls are painted the coats of arms of the sixty Land Governors of Carniola, followed by the coats of arms of the five Austrian rulers on the chancel ceiling, and the coats of arms of the Duchy of Carniola, the Border County of Istria and the Duchy of Slovene Landscape on the ceiling to round off the whole composition; the coats of arms of the Duchy of Carniola, the Border County of Istria and the Duchy of Slovene Landscapes are on the chapel ceiling. The chapel was first decorated with them between 1742 and 1747. The first year, 1742, is on the painting plan held by the Archives of the Republic of Slovenia (ARS), while the year 1747 is painted in the chapel itself, next to an inscription stating that the coats of arms were to be restored in that year, but this may be an error and the coats of arms may have been painted for the first time at that time. The chapel was probably also restored in 1849, when the west wall and its armorial decoration were demolished. In 1915 the chapel was rebuilt again, this time after the earthquake. In the late 1980s, a final and thorough restoration began, which was completed in the early 1990s, including the west wall, and the coats of arms were to be restored to their original appearance. At least roughly. <p/> Miha Preinfalk from the Scientific Research Centre of the SAZU and Prof. Barbara Žabota, Professor of History and Sociology, examined the fate of the coats of arms in St George's Chapel at the beginning of the new millennium (see bottom of the page), from the time of their creation to the present day, and pointed out the many discrepancies and mistakes that occurred during the renovations. They also give five lists of the coats of arms depicted and compare them. We will concentrate on the first two only. The first list gives the probable state of the original painting and is based on the 1742 painting plan. The basis for its creation (not only the content, form and order of the inscriptions, but also the coats of arms themselves and their heraldic style) is the list of regional governors in Valvasor's Slav of the Duchy of Carniola (the first fifty-six governors). Whether Valvasor's list is historically accurate or not is of secondary importance for our presentation of the coats of arms. The second list shows the present state after the last renovation, as visitors can see it on the walls of the chapel. <p/>There are considerable differences between the lists themselves in terms of variations in the form of the inscriptions (e.g. MAJNHARD or MAYHART), minor sloppiness (e.g. SEVFNIG instead of SEVENIG) or errors (e.g. BERG. instead of BEGR. " begraben " or buried), which probably occurred during the restorations. Also, the 12 coats of arms have incorrect years. Errors are also found among the regnal coats of arms. Thus, the correct date of death of Archduke Charles is in fact 10 July 1590, and not as indicated in the first and second lists, which are compared below. Duchess Mary (wife of the aforementioned Archduke Charles) was not the daughter of Duke Albert IV of Bohemia, as shown in the current situation or in the second list, but in fact the daughter of Duke Albert V of Bavaria (BOEHMEN instead of BAYERN), as the coat-of-arms image itself testifies. <p/> In the photographs below we can compare the two lists. The captions on the photographs show the current state of the frescoes on the walls of St George's Chapel, while the captions below the photographs show the first list, or the list based on the 1742 plan for the frescoes. <p/> Discrepancies and errors also occurred during the painting or restoration of the coats of arms. In most cases, where there has been a discrepancy, it is simply a case of using the wrong colour of a field or attribute, or sometimes of using the wrong pictorial template altogether.

__label__objective Zdus to continue campaign of visiting MPs in their offices <p/> Ljubljana, 23 September (STA) - The Federation of Pensioners' Associations of Slovenia (Zdus) will continue the campaign of visiting MPs in their offices, which it started last week. The aim of the campaign is to make MPs more sensitive to the needs of their constituents, thereby raising the quality of decision-making in the National Assembly and restoring the National Assembly's reputation, the federation said. <p/> On the first day of the campaign last Monday, 16 September, 217 constituents took part, visiting 52 MPs and interacting with an additional 22 MPs. Ten MPs apologised, four did not attend the meeting despite having agreed to do so, two MPs did not want to meet constituents and 16 MPs were not contacted at all. <p/> Monday's meeting with MEPs was held under the slogan 'No pensions, no recourse'. According to V Zdus, they met with understanding and support from many MPs. However, they found that some were not yet ready to speak for themselves, but "in the language of the party to which they belong". <p/> The campaign will continue to present the real problems of the population to the MPs and to demand that they be addressed. The short-term objective of the campaign is to have all MPs available to constituents once a week by March 2014 and the medium-term objective is for constituents to get to know their MPs well by the 2015 elections. This would help them decide who to vote for in the National Assembly. "Some MPs still do not have or do not have offices, and MPs receive a special allowance for their work in the field," points out Zdus.

__label__objective Insulin <p/> Insulin is a peptide (protein) hormone produced and secreted by the pancreas. It is produced by the so-called ß cells of the pancreas, from which it is secreted into the venous blood, which travels to the liver and then on to the systemic circulation. <p/> Structure of insulin <p/> Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains. Its chemical structure is C 254 H 377 N 65 O 75 S 6. <p/> Action and effects of insulin <p/> Insulin acts on many tissues in the body (liver, fat, muscle). Its primary function is to store energy peaks in the body (mainly to stimulate the synthesis of glycogen from glucose - glycogenesis). The main stimulus for its secretion is an increase in the amount of glucose in the blood. Insulin has a short half-life, so as glucose falls, its concentration in the blood falls rapidly. <p/> Which cells does insulin act on? <p/> Insulin acts on virtually all cells in the body, as insulin receptors are present on all of them. The difference between cells is that different cell types contain different numbers of these receptors (from a few 10 to over 100 000).

__label__subjective Match Preview: Real Madrid-Borussia Dortmund <p/> Real Madrid, who have won seven consecutive Champions League matches at home, will take on the Bundesliga champions in tonight's match. The aim is to win three more points to regain top spot in the group two rounds before the end of this competition. <p/> Real Madrid return to the Champions League with the aim of regaining top spot in Group D after their match against Borussia Dortmund (20:45). The Whites will be looking to capitalise on the unconditional support of their fans, who are literally overwhelmed by such Champions League matches and who will be cheering the White Ballet on to an eighth consecutive European victory at the Santiago Bernabeu. The Spanish league champions and top scorers in this year's Champions League will take on the winners of last year's Bundesliga and one of the few teams still undefeated in this year's European competition tonight. The importance of the opponent and the objective of reaching the top of the group again two rounds before the end of this part of the competition makes this match extremely serious and predicts one of the most interesting evenings in European football. <p/> More than a month and a half after their first Champions League match, Real Madrid will play their second match in this competition on home soil. The Whites will take on Borussia Dortmund with the aim of winning and returning to the top of the Group D standings two rounds before the end of the group stage. If they beat the German side, they will lead the standings by two points over Dortmund, but Real then have two more games to play: Manchester City away and Ajax at home. <p/> GROUP D <p/> City <p/> Team <p/> W <p/> N <p/> P <p/> Gd <p/> Gr <p/> Points <p/> 1 <p/> Borussia Dortmund <p/> 2 <p/> 1 <p/> 1 <p/> 0 <p/> 4 <p/> 2 <p/> 2 <p/> 7 <p/> 2 <p/> Real Madrid <p/> 2 <p/> 0 <p/> 1 <p/> 1 <p/> 8 <p/> 5 <p/> 3 <p/> 6 <p/> 3 <p/> 3 <p/> Ajax Amsterdam <p/> 1 <p/> 0 <p/> 0 <p/> 2 <p/> 4 <p/> 6 <p/> - -2 <p/> 3 <p/> 4 <p/> Manchester City <p/> 0 <p/> 1 <p/> 2 <p/> 4 <p/> 7 <p/> -3 <p/> 1 <p/> Another unwavering connection between the team and the fans at the Santiago Bernabeu will help the Whites to reach their goal.

Ajax (3-0), Lyon (4-0), Dinamo Zagreb (6-2), CSKA Moscow (4-1), APOEL (5-2), Bayern (2-1) and Manchester City (3-2) are the opponents who have lost consecutively against the team from the Spanish capital.

The French striker, on the other hand, will be a notable absentee for Real, but despite that, this team has proven its attacking power on several occasions. In fact, Real's goal scoring in this competition is something to remember. The Real Madrid team has the highest number of goals in this competition (8 goals) and Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored five of them, is currently the top scorer in the Champions League this season. <p/> Borussia Dortmund, Bundesliga champions in the previous two seasons, are not doing so well at home this season, finishing in fifth place with 16 points, 11 behind leaders Bayern.

__label__subjective Severe consequences <p/> Phuket... a well-known island all over the world. It attracts a lot of tourists from all over.It reminds me a bit of Zakynthos except that it is bigger and of course has bigger and nicer beaches. <p/> On arrival at the airport we booked a hotel in Patong Beach. We rented motorbikes and this is where our exploration of the island began. <p/> TRAFFIC In Thailand, traffic is on the left (as in England). We had rented a car earlier when we were in the north. At first, my father had problems driving. The steering wheel is on the right hand side and then everything else gets confused. When he wanted to turn on the indicator he turned on the windscreen wipers instead. Luckily we took the automatic, otherwise he would have had problems with the gearshift, because he was repeatedly looking for the lever on the right side, where the door was. <p/> I am quite an experienced "motorcyclist" myself. I've been driving my scooter around for about 4 years, so I took over as driver and drove my mum around. I thought that driving on the left side would be a bit of a hassle, but I got used to it quickly. I had more trouble parking in the garage.Almost everybody here drives motorbikes and then, of course, they have special garages for motorbikes. Other road users also gave me a bit more trouble. People overtake here on the left and right, sometimes elsewhere if they can. There are no rules, so you really have to be alert and careful for your own safety. <p/> SUN After a short sightseeing tour of the island, swimming followed. Almost all the beaches here are sandy and more crowded with sunbeds, umbrellas, etc. When you want to have a nice rest, there are already vendors from the "shanties" selling all kinds of things on the beach (watches, food, clothes... ). After a rest and a swim, we drove to a shopping centre a little further away. It was already really hot outside so I couldn't wait to see the cold shops. Trying on clothes in the mirror, I was surprised by the bright red colour of my hands, just like tomatoes. The sun was burning me badly. I must admit that I didn't put on much sunblock. My skin is naturally darker and I have a lot of pigment. As soon as the sunny days start I get a nice tan. I don't like to sunbathe and I know it's not healthy. I have never had problems with sunburn and that is why I am much more surprised. <p/> I was burnt on my arms (mainly because of the motorbike), shoulders, knees and of course the bottom of my legs. The sun is much stronger here than here and the change, when the body is not used to such a high amount of heat and sun, is also to blame for my severe burns, in addition to the fact that I didn't put enough sunscreen on. <p/> I was in for a hard, tiring night full of pain. Aloe Vera and menthol rubs, as well as after-sun creams and compresses, helped my recovery. Today I am much better and even the red colour has changed to a nicer, more tanned brown. <p/> From now on I will not go anywhere without sun cream and I will apply it much more often, because I am risking my life. A lot of times, the effects of the sun lead to skin cancer and also to more wrinkled and aged skin, and I don't want to have wrinkled skin at 18 and risk skin cancer!

__label__subjective @ PJ. I will briefly repeat my reply to your comment: congratulations and good health to you in the future. I wonder if you have written down the diagnosis " lame from the waist down ", and the cure somewhere. Do you keep this knowledge you have gained to yourself or are you interested in sharing it with someone else who is dealing with a similar intractable problem. <p/> For me it is a little different. A very aggressive form of cancer with a very poor prognosis (in terms of percentage cured) was contracted by a family member. Unexpectedly, while she was waiting for surgery, I gave her a month of therapy using the procedure or technique carried out by Zdenko Domančič and his team. For 30 days, 2x a day. I did the therapies exclusively at her request, it is difficult to explain how this came about. On the third day her condition started to improve. She was able to start walking up stairs again, she hadn't been able to do it before, she had a cold all winter, she had difficulty breathing, sinus problems, chronically blocked nose, she hadn't smelled for a year. No antibiotic was helping her effectively anymore. In the meantime, while she was waiting for the operation (she had to undergo a few more tests), she was not receiving any medication to treat her cancer. When she was operated on, it was found that, of the five tumours, four had disappeared and one had gone from 15 mm to about 5 mm. I admit that I am not foolish and I do not know what we managed in the long run. Time will tell. I am still continuing with the therapies, following the advice of the people in the bioenergetician's circle. <p/> That is why I was interested in your description of the effect of the energy flow on the diseased tissue. <p/> @David: as I have said before, and I feel you are realising yourself, vanity can be a problem here and difficult to overcome. So I will just say this: the conclusion is that you are on the right path. It might be worth familiarising yourself with the content on stimulating the pituitary gland. <p/> @david: I do not know if we have understood each other correctly. I can imagine what it is like for you in the situation you are in ... We too were diagnosed with cancer three years ago with the youngest in the family. Unfortunately, at that time I was not yet aware of the therapy that was being researched in the 1960s and was supposedly achieving excellent results. <p/> As I said, it was roughly about (electromagnetic) stimulation of the pituitary gland. This resulted in the formation of bodies that fed on the malignant cells, which reduced the tumour. At the same time, the inhibitors, in turn, inhibited the development or proliferation of stem cells into malignant cells... <p/>I'm sorry I didn't go into the details, but if I had another chance, I would have. We said goodbye to the youngest in our family a year ago. I suspect, however, that what you are describing is exactly this model of treatment. <p/>David, now a word of caution: P.J. obviously brings spices that the dish does not need to tickle you in the first place, and then writes about inferring that it is a crowd that is supposed to be on the right path. This makes you an information broker for others and no longer just for yourself (different levels of responsibility, after all...). <p/> I did not follow your dialogue and I have no idea what it is about ... but I am naturally cautious about similar transitions from singular to plural. <p/> Ah, that post cut off part of the communication - but as far as I'm concerned, it's still the case that a person should give partly different information on his/her own behalf than if he/she gives it on behalf of a group (even if it's the same joint project of whatever). <p/> @ niko: thanks for the warning. It should have used a colon. I'm sprinkling myself with ashes for that mistake. <p/> As for responsibility, I have to agree with you. In caring for the patient, we (each individual who accepts this role - not to get bogged down with interpretation again) are about to take (again, each individual) full (co-) responsibility for the outcome. <p/> P.S.: Perhaps a clarification on why the change from singular to plural (or, as written, more correctly - dual). <p/> In most treatments there is a patient and a therapist. The course of treatment and cure also depends on the patient and not only on the therapist. Hence the sentence that both of you (all involved), judging by the results described, are (are) on the right path. <p/>@PJ. Now I understand. I can see that you have had quite a few difficult ordeals. Actually, this technique that I am using is the work of Zdenek Domančič. Personally, I think that this therapy has a holistic effect on the patient's immune system (I have seen it myself in several patients after only a few days) and that the body may (or may not, depending of course on the patient's condition) react positively and fight the condition more easily. Although the very act of laying on of hands makes the cancer cells feel unwell. Anyway, if you are interested in more, go to youtube and type in the name of the bioenergetician mentioned, there is a lot said there and research has also been done at various institutions around Slovenia (jozef stefan, I think also at the oncoloske) ... <p/> @Niko, thank you for your concern, but I no longer worry about being unfairly grouped somewhere or thrown in some trash can. I've been called everything from a janissist, to a right-winger, to a pro-Russia, left-winger, and so on, on blogs <p/> @Niko, I don't resent anyone. We're all just human, which is why blog-level resentment is absurdly fucking ridiculous. Which ends up being cruel when someone keeps slandering and moderating you. And yet absurd if the cause is "virtual" <p/> I'm not saying I don't resent things too, I do, but it has to be related to a greater amount of money, time, and consequently unattained planned goals. <p/> Man, you weren't disciplining anyone - you were just defending yourself. There was no talk of overstepping the bounds of power. , <p/> There is a note somewhere here among the older posts about how it came about that I put Dajana in spam (etting) and she no longer has access to this blog - the only one and it really wasn't my intention to oppress anyone in such a way, but with her all the normal solutions fall away (the woman is polluting all over the place for absolutely no reason). She only understands that one step too far towards the abyss. <p/> I forgot to leave this link here, under this heading, which was the trigger for the end-to-end, over-amplified and predictable clichéd parroting with the noticeable manifestations of dementia of the blogger Dajana and of the gentleman who has sovereign mastery of the knowledge and functioning of the egos of bitches, Mr Ervinatro. <p/> For your amusement, nobody has given me as much publicity as these two have done on the siol! <p/> werner, you must be very young, I can tell by your naive euphoric conclusions, hehe ... <p/> but I find this strange: in all the American films, the Russians are Americans - well, sometimes Yugos In no time at all, all the "Russians" speak English <p/> and then they make the film in such a way that the Russians are made to look like cowards. ------- similarly with the commentators on the net ... ........................ . hint: for me, the "smart" person is the one who gives me money and pays me for it - all the others are ballast that I shake off <p/> You don't know, but my teachers know that there is so much of what I do in me - purely from within, without reading, imitating or going anywhere to get knowledge ... , I just like to go and test what is in me. And I get confirmations. <p/> Dear Dragica, ************ the guspa who is so fond of mentioning us misses us = will and love. That is a fact. ****** = she gets bo if she has a boyfriend (she mentions quite a few guys from her life), and love in such a way that everyone would bow down to her and it should be her way. *************** But the guspa herself does nothing to make any of it happen. Because she is hateful and labile. Not even Abraham helps her! ! Maybe I will - because I do everything with love. I will show love to her too. In a slightly different way. ******************** Actually, I feel sorry for her. She's deprived of everyone she expected anything from. But that's her own fault. When she realises that she is doing injustice to countless people by slandering them and spreading lies about them, she will be on the right path to realising love. ************************************************** And when she does, I will be the first one to embrace her. I promise. *************************************************** P.S. If a man wants to get something, he has to give it. And if a man wants to get love, he has to give it. *************************************** But if a man sows hatred, he gets back only hatred. ********************************************* And here the guspa is enormous. ******************* The mind will meet it when it knows what love really is. ******************************************** <p/> My dear Dragica, publicity is only for the benefit, hehe, not for the detriment. ************************************** Many people want to meet me, and you too, and NIkota, because of what is written about us. which is a plus for us. ********************************* And whoever wants to have a clear and clean picture, and a mirror, comes to us, isn't it? And then we meet all the wonderful people. Which is worth gold. <p/> Dear Mrs Vlatka: there will be no food or drink from IF and KO ... KO / IF and KO do not germinate for too long. And I can guarantee you, dear lady, that there will never be anything. A little fear, a little mudslinging - then her nose gets used to the new smell. <p/> You just go be a do-gooder, as long as it's not at someone else's expense (you know, even when someone is patient, considerate, forgiving, etc. in such a case, it's only fair as long as insults are flying at their expense: being tolerant of pyromaniacs while they're burning down your neighbour's house is not tolerance...). <p/> Extremely well written and admirable. I am conditioned to find a grain of truth through reading when I learn it from myself, so I am doomed to plagiarism in anything I recognise as good. <p/>The teacher who imparted knowledge to me left me a few years ago after 25 years of teaching, after letting me know that he had learned enough from me to feel that he had fulfilled his task and was leaving this world. So I continue my mission as a disciple, absorbing knowledge from all those who are eager to learn.
__label__objective VARSTOR, JERNEJ ŠTORGELJ, s.p.from Rečice ob Savinji specialises in robotic welding. They also perform welding by other processes such as MIG welding and TIG welding. <p/> WELDING <p/> Welding is the process of joining two materials to form a single unit by means of heat or mechanical kneading. <p/> In welding, the heat source is an electric arc generated by the welding machine. The joining of materials is based on the temperature generated by the electric arc. This welding process is called arc welding. <p/> WELDING PROCEDURES <p/> MIG/MAG welding <p/> MIG/MAG welding involves the generation of an electric arc by means of a welding source. The arc is formed between the welding wire and the weldment. The arc joins the weldment and the filler material to form a weld joint or weld. <p/> During the actual welding process, the feeding device feeds the wire continuously through the torch to the welding site. Shielding gas is also added via the torch. <p/> MIG welding differs from MAG welding in the use of shielding gas. MIG welding uses an inert gas which does not react chemically with the welding consumable. MAG welding, on the other hand, uses an active gas which reacts chemically with the weld metal. <p/> Typically, the shielding gas contains active carbon dioxide or oxygen, which is why MAG welding is more common than MIG welding. <p/> TIG welding <p/> In TIG welding (Tugsten Inert Gas), an electric arc is created between the non-fusible tungsten electrode and the weld metal. An inert gas is used as a shielding gas which does not react with the weld. The most commonly used shielding gas in TIG welding is argon. <p/> In TIG welding, the addition of material is not always necessary. The joint between two weldments can also be made by welding their edges. If material is added, it must be added manually. For this reason, TIG welding sources are built differently from MIG/MAG sources. <p/> The different TIG methods include DC, AC and pulsed TIG welding. <p/> MANUAL WELDING <p/> Welding processes <p/> Welding processes are divided into several phases according to the degree of automation, namely. <p/> Semi-automatic welding - a specific working step is carried out automatically. One such welding method is MIG/MAG welding, where the welding wire is fed through the torch by a feeding device. <p/> In mechanised welding, some manipulative work is also done by machine, with the welder controlling the welding process. <p/> In automatic welding, the welding hardware performs the entire process independently of the preset programme. <p/> Robotic welding represents a very advanced welding mechanisation and automation. In robotic welding, a control system controls the movement of the torch and the manipulation of the welder. The robot can be programmed for different welding applications, so we are talking about the highest possible level of automation of the welding process. <p/> Robotic welding is most commonly used for products where the surfaces to be joined are curved and where several small welds in different directions are required. The reason for the purchase is not necessarily for mass production of products. Modern technologies allow for the increasing production of smaller batches of products. Individual parts have also been successfully produced in robotic workshops.
__label__objective Case-law: Admissibility of a revision 05.10.2015 According to settled case-law, if the claimant does not state the value of the object at issue for each individual claim, but only states the total value, this is not sufficient for the admissibility of a revision. <p/> The Court of First Instance dismissed the claims that the defendants were obliged to enter into a contract of sale with the plaintiffs, pursuant to which they would sell the property to them and the plaintiffs were obliged to pay the defendants the unpaid part of the purchase price. The applicants also claimed that the defendants were obliged to deliver possession of the property to them and to pay them a monthly fee until delivery. <p/> The Court of First Instance dismissed the applicants' appeal and upheld the judgment under appeal. The applicants lodged an appeal against the final judgment, raising all the grounds of appeal and seeking an amendment of the judgment under appeal to allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of First Instance and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial. <p/> The review was not allowed. The applicants brought three claims against the three defendants. The claims for the conclusion of a contract of sale and for the delivery of immovable property are non-monetary claims for which the right to review depends on the value of the subject-matter in dispute. Notwithstanding Article 41(2) of the Civil Procedure Act (CPL), the value of the contested part of a final judgment is to be determined by adding together the values of the individual claims or parts of those claims which are still in dispute, where the decision on the review depends on the resolution of legal issues common to all those claims or where the individual claims are so interrelated that the decision on one claim depends on the decision on another claim (Article 367(5) CPL). However, in the case of the first two claims (for the conclusion of the contract of sale and for the delivery of the immovable property), there is not only an objective cumulation, but also a subjective one. There are three defendants. <p/> Where a claim is brought against several defendants, it is incumbent on the plaintiff, pursuant to Article 41(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, to state the value of the object of the dispute for each defendant individually and not for all the defendants jointly. If the plaintiff fails to do so and in such a case states only one value of the subject-matter in dispute for all defendants together, this is a so-called undifferentiated value of the subject-matter in dispute. <p/> The defendants are not united co-defendants, since they are not in such a substantive community that only the same decision for all three would be possible. Since they are co-owners and can dispose of their co-ownership interest in the immovable property independently, the defendants are ordinary co-defendants within the meaning of Article 191(1)(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, and the aggregation of values under Article 41(1) in conjunction with Article 367(5) of the Civil Procedure Code is therefore not applicable in such a case. <p/> Moreover, the claimants are also ordinary co-claimants, since they claim the conclusion of the contract and delivery of possession each for themselves in accordance with their share of the joint ownership. In view of the co-partnership relationship on both sides, the Supreme Court found that there were six claims, each of which could share a separate legal fate. The admissibility of the revision would therefore be judged on the value of each individual claim. <p/> However, since the applicants did not indicate the value of the subject-matter at issue for each individual claim, but only one, aggregate value (EUR 135,000) was indicated, this is an undifferentiated indication of the value of the subject-matter at issue, which, according to settled case-law, is not sufficient for the admissibility of the revision. It is not possible to determine to which of the claimants and to which of the defendants the total value of the disputed object referred to in the application relates, so that the situation is the same as if the value of the disputed object had not been mentioned at all, which means that the revision is not admissible. Since the value of the pecuniary claim also did not exceed the threshold of EUR 40 000, the review is not admissible in that respect either. In accordance with Article 377 of the CPC, the Court of Review dismissed the unauthorised revision.
__label__subjective safety glasses <p/> hearing protection <p/> work protection <p/> safety helmets <p/> safety helmet with visor <p/> Safety glasses and hearing and head protection - a wide selection <p/> Safety glasses are often one of the basic work protections. Good quality safety glasses protect your eyes from mechanical and chemical damage, so you should go for nothing but the best when choosing safety glasses (similarly for hearing and head protection). Wondering where to buy the best quality safety glasses? The answer is Trgos in Lesce. We specialise in importing and selling top quality workwear, hearing protection and eye and head protection (hard hats and more). <p/> Safety glasses available in different designs <p/> Before choosing the right safety glasses, you should think carefully about the features you expect. Is it important that the goggles are equipped with solar filters? Are you looking for safety glasses with lenses that do not dew? Perhaps you need chlorofibre safety glasses? Do you wear corrective glasses and are interested in safety glasses that can be worn over traditional glasses? Do the glasses also need to have side protection? We have a range of safety glasses suitable for different circumstances, so finding the ideal glasses to protect your vision while you work won't be difficult. Of course, we can help you choose the really best safety glasses for your specific circumstances, but we're also the right place to go if you're interested in hearing protection at work. <p/> Optimum hearing and head protection <p/> In many jobs, hearing protection and head protection with the help of a safety helmet is also very important. Hearing protection can sometimes be provided with good quality earplugs, but there are also circumstances where full hearing protection requires the use of mufflers. Whatever kind of hearing protection you are interested in, you will find the ideal ear or hearing protection here. Probably even more important than hearing and eye protection are safety helmets. Among other things, we offer a safety helmet with a visor made of golden, dark glass. A visor helmet provides complete protection for the entire head. Thus, a visor helmet is an accessory that protects you from many dangers and is therefore definitely worth buying.
__label__subjective Festival Speculum Artium 2019 and DigitalBigScreen 2019 <p/> 11th International Festival of New Media Culture <p/> The 11th edition of the festival will take place at the Trbovlje Workers' Centre from 17 to 19 October this year, with many guests from all over the world. <p/> Speculum Artiumpresents authors and projects at the intersection of art, science and technology. <p/> The Speculum Artium Festival of New Media Culture celebrated its tenth anniversary last year and has since established itself as the leading festival of its kind in Slovenia and a household name around the world. During its existence, it has hosted some of the leading names in high-tech, science and art, such as Hiroshi Ishiguro, Honda Robotics, Stelarc, Victoria Vesna, as well as local artists such as Robertina Šebjanič, Srečo Dragan and Laibach. <p/> The tenth anniversary was also an opportunity to take stock of the work done and to look to the future of the festival, which is one of only three of its kind that the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia recognises as being of high quality and renown, and for this reason also provides financial support for its implementation. In the spirit of the times and the development of both visual culture and technology, the festival's management decided to focus on virtual worlds and 3D environments. <p/> One of the flagship projects this year is the Brain Computer Hackathon, the first event of its kind in Slovenia. In addition, the Tree project, jointly developed by American artists Milica Zec and Winslow Porter, is also worth mentioning. The project uses new technologies and 3D environments for an engaging approach to a very topical issue, which environmental protection and climate change certainly are. Using 3D environments, haptic interfaces and sound effects, the artists put us in the position of a tree in a tropical rainforest. We can feel how the tree grows in its environment and how it is affected by climatic conditions. The project was presented at the World Economic Forum 2018 in Davos and attracted a lot of interest among the influencers gathered there. <p/> Also working with virtual worlds is British artist Nicola Plant, who will be presenting her project Parallax at the festival, which shares the thoughts of individual visitors in a virtual environment with all other visitors by sensing their movements and facial expressions, testing the possibilities of non-verbal communication between people in a world that is increasingly moving towards virtual reality. Borders in the digital environment are also being broken down by Bulgarian new media artist Ivan Petkov, who will present his installation My Country, Your Country, which allows visitors to draw the borders of real or fictional countries on the screen themselves, highlighting the fact that borders are in fact an artificial construct of the human mind and not something natural. <p/> While showcasing global productions, the festival does not neglect local new media artists. This year, among others, Saša Nemec, with the project Inside/Outside, and Boštjan Čadež, with the VR installation PD4, will be presented.
__label__subjective I can't help but notice that on 4 May 2004, D.R.I. were supposed to open their concert in Gali hala Metelkova with a skateboarding competition in the courtyard in front of the above-mentioned venue. The rain prevented any sporting events during the day, but the quartet from San Francisco (allegedly) rocked the inside of the hall, while I stayed at home in front of the book and concentrated on the exam I had scheduled for the next day - Fail. <p/> It's been more than 7 years to the day, the day the Dirty Rotten Imbeciles showed up again at the same venue. The aforementioned exam, which I successfully passed just under three months ago, would no longer (and has not been) an obstacle to not seeing the legends live with my own eyes this time around. <p/> Monday, officially the first day of summer, if we look at our calendar, where the number 6 (the month of June) is accompanied by the number 21, was the day or evening when, under the baton of the Dirty Skunks duo, the local Eruption took the stage in front of the D.R.I. and played their repertoire for about ¾ of an hour, at 10.30 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. minutes, and then it literally exploded - a visibly moody Harald Oimoen with a Radio Študent T-shirt on bass guitar, Spike Cassidy on six-string, Rob Rampy on drums in the background and the legend Kurt Brecht on vocals raised the temperature in the hall with the very first rhythms, which was filled with old school punk and thrash metal fans who were with the foursome from start to finish, as they blasted through practically the entire repertoire from the Dirty Rotten LP to the latest studio album Full Speed Ahead in an hour and a half. <p/> " The hits " came one after the other, the stage diving got worse and worse, the floor got wetter and wetter, and the temperature rose, peaking with Violent Pacification. <p/> After two extremely short (chik) pauses, the band was more than happy to return to the stage, play a couple of bonus tracks and let us know that the Five Year Plan repertoire was done. <p/> And if my attempt in 2004 was along the lines of "I lose, you win ...", 7 years later, the way I see it, it's the other way around - I WIN, YOU LOSE!
__label__subjective My living room soothes me <p/> I decided to write a little about my favourite room. Since I am a man, it is definitely not the kitchen but the living room. Probably every one of us has a room in which we relax the best and easiest, and for me it's definitely my living room, which I have furnished to suit my needs. I remember that when I was buying a new living room, I spent an enormous amount of time, because I was quite a demanding buyer. Every man will probably agree that there is nothing better than half-lounging in front of the television in your living room and enjoying watching football, laughing while listening to politicians or simply watching one of the popular science channels. I have the habit of sometimes using my living room for reading, because I like to read a lot. It is also the case in our house that the living room is where we spend most of our time when we are not working, of course. But I am one of those people who does not like to visit my living room, because I am of the opinion that living rooms are in a way too private a place to invite friends into. After all, there is nothing more reassuring to me than being able to lie down in front of the television in my living room in just my underpants. <p/> Living room ideas <p/> Sometimes a friend asks me where I got the idea for my original living room. My living room is custom-made, and most of the time it's a collection of all the best ideas I've got from different furniture catalogues. I have to admit that I like the Scandinavian type of furniture because everything is made of wood, and that's what my living room is. Wooden living rooms are something special for me. It is the wood that gives the living room warmth and makes it feel homely. <p/> Sometimes you can get a good idea in the furniture showrooms themselves. Maybe you should go to a furniture showroom on a Saturday morning and see what kind of living rooms they have on display. Sometimes you will get an incredible amount of ideas. But I recommend you go to the bigger centres where there will be dozens of living rooms on display. <p/>This entry was posted in Home and Garden and tagged living rooms. Bookmark the permalink.

__label__subjective In 1990, Mr Tihomil Peloz opened the first butcher's shop in Šempeter. Three more were opened soon after (Miren, Vrtojba and Nova Gorica). As we expanded, so did our desire to sell our own products alongside those of others. <p/> The production plant at Loke 1a was completed in 1998, at which time all the conditions were in place for the establishment of Peloz d.o.o., a company for the processing of meat and the production of meat products. The new facility, built to European standards and equipped with the latest technology, has 1200 m2 of production space. Highly qualified workers and own recipes are the guarantee for top quality products. <p/> The demand for our products, which is steadily increasing in quantity, has forced us to expand. In 2005, we started building works to double our production capacity of cured meats. Today, even the new capacity is already fully occupied. We have already started to prepare the plans for the new expansion. <p/> In our wide range of products, we have put the emphasis on dried meat products - the Carpathian range. Although we have only been on the market for a short time, our brand is already well recognised. While our retail outlets mainly cover the Goriška region, our products are available from our business partners (Spar, Mercator, Eurospin). We also supply smaller customers throughout Slovenia by direct delivery. <p/> Quality and competitive prices promise us to expand to places where we have not been present before. The awards and recognitions we have received so far only confirm the quality of our products. Special mention should be made of the Chamber of Commerce's award for the most beautifully decorated plant, which we received in 2004 in the category of small enterprises.
__label__subjective ŠENT's summer days <p/> We spent a varied and interesting summer days at the ŠENT Trbovlje Day Centre, which is dedicated to individuals with mental health problems, those who find themselves in mental distress, their relatives and anyone interested in the field of mental health. We were creative and in a holiday mood. <p/> We meet every working day between 8am and 6pm in our pleasantly decorated premises, which we have redecorated and refurbished during the summer (which would not have been possible without the goodwill of our volunteers and service users). We try to fill each day with as many interesting activities as possible. We like to invite guests and volunteers to join us. <p/> So we relaxed in the company of guitarist Juret Jahn, who played us some popular party tunes and some songs from different historical periods. It was the first time we had listened to such a challenging programme played on the guitar and we were more than surprised. During the lecture by the athlete Mitya Duh, we learnt a lot about running and healthy living, and were inspired by his energy for life. Volunteer Špela Natek visited us and introduced us to a new way of making corrugated cardboard boxes. The boxes and all our other products are available at the Trbovlje market stall once a month. <p/> We organised three swimming trips, which would not have been possible without the generous support of our donors. We would like to thank Thermana d.d., Dobrega počutja Laško, Rimski Terme d.o.o. and ZPO Celje d.o.o. for the donation of the swimming tickets. <p/> On a sunny Friday in July, the premises of the Day Centre were filled with competition fever, as a large number of us took part in a darts tournament. The competitiveness soon turned into mutual encouragement and cooperation. The prizes were also shared in a sporting spirit. <p/> Once a month we hosted the President of our association, Mag. Ed P. Belak, who gives lectures and leads discussion groups. We always invite anyone who would like to join us, collaborate with us, learn something new, just chat or share their knowledge to participate in the group and in all our other activities.

It's been a long time since such a wimp and a narcissist. Why does this Mrs Hren always know more than her guests? And not just seemingly more, actually. She has all the figures in her head that Pahor does not even know exist, and she knows all the proposals that have been put to him, but he is just spouting empty straw. When he was filmed up close, you could see his hands shaking. Of course, it is those who are not up to something who are afraid. And this virtuous Pahor of ours was not even up to a TV interview on how to run a country. I dare not imagine. <p/>I have always gone to elections because I am a very principled person. I have always said that if you do not go to vote, then you must never even write if you do not like something in the country. It seemed to me that elections should be compulsory, like in Australia.

My personal opinion is that the reviewer should keep his distance, especially with regard to various proposals, initiatives, requests and the like. Otherwise, every John of Carniola will be salting his brain. On the other hand, it would be good if he could establish some kind of communication with the "base", because in this way he could explain in general terms, not on a concrete example, what he can and cannot do, and perhaps he could also say something about the rules and their meaning. As for the specific case - I believe that the reviewer has to publish the treasure, even if the description is scarce or even non-existent. Just as he has to publish the treasure, whether it is a technical masterpiece or a box of cottage cheese.

The point of it all is that the club has only contributed or helped to set up a Slovenian reviewer. But once Grounspeak HQ has enthroned him, he is only working according to their rules and his own judgement.
__label__objective Hotel Diana: Olga Belec wins in lawsuit between two female directors <p/> Court rejects Jasna Klepec's claim to annul the contract <p/> A ruling by the District Court in Murska Sobota has brought to an end a lawsuit in which Jasna Klepec, the owner of Hotel Diana, had sought to annul the contract by which she and her business partner Željko Jovanović bought a stake in the company from Olga Belec and her son Patrick Belec at the end of 2018. Luka Podjed, a Ljubljana-based lawyer who is defending Belč, says that the court expectedly rejected Klepč's claim and that it was, in his opinion, fundamentally unfounded. "The court followed our arguments completely and found that there was no payment in cash. It also found that Klepčeva had obtained all the necessary information about the state of the company and the real estate, or had the opportunity to obtain it." Klepčeva based her claim on allegations that Belčeva had not informed her of all the details of the company's business, including certain liabilities owed to employees, before signing the contract. The contract thus remains valid and, as previously reported, Hotel Diana has since ended up in bankruptcy. In addition to the annulment of the contract, Klepčeva's lawsuit also sought the reimbursement of the purchase price, claiming that it amounted to EUR 80 000 in total, although the contract, which was also notarised, stated an amount of EUR 30 000. <p/> Aleš Cipot <p/> Olga Belec <p/> Klepčeva claimed that, as agreed, on the day of the signing of the contract, 50 thousand euros were handed over to Belčeva in cash, allegedly by Matej Hofinger, a businessman from Velenje, who acted as an intermediary in the transaction, but they did not provide any evidence to convince the judge, Marjetica Škerget Logar, of their claims. Klepčeva says she is disappointed with the court's decision and will appeal it. Olga Belec welcomes the court's decision to the contrary, and believes that the allegations in the claim were fabricated. "This proves what I have been saying all along, that the sale was transparent. I even went to help the new management for the first two months after the sale. I sold the company in good faith, because the buyers assured me that they would also buy the property, which I did not have enough money to do myself. So I was glad that someone who supposedly could save the company bought it, but if I had known that things would turn out this way, I would never have sold it to them." As for the allegations of receiving cash, Belčeva reiterates that this never happened. She adds that she herself has thought a lot about how such allegations could have come about: "I wonder whether Matej Hofinger might not have really received the money from Klepčeva, but gave it to someone else. In any case, the whole affair was about diverting attention to me, because I was State Secretary at the time, while the company was being financially drained."

__label__subjective NSI and SDS: Mojca Kucler Dolinar wants to give Ljubljana new substance <p/> Tuesday, 28.2.2012 <p/> At today's press conference, Mojca Kucler Dolinar presented her candidacy for mayor of Ljubljana. She began by stressing that Ljubljana needs new leadership, freshness, economy and responsibility. At the press conference, her candidacy was endorsed by representatives of New Slovenia and the Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS): Anton Kranjc, representative of the NSi City Committee, Dragutin Mate, President of the SDS City Committee, Dr Žiga Turk, Minister of Education, Culture and Sport, Aleš Hojs, Minister of Defence, and the Director of the Government Communications Office, Mag. Anže Logar. <p/> As she said in her opening remarks, from the very beginning of the identification process, she has been working to bring the Spring Spring Day parties together to agree on a joint candidacy. Both the initiative and the support then came from the ranks of the Slovenian Democratic Party. The candidacy is first and foremost the result of her personal decision. The candidacy is a particular challenge for her - she is familiar with the mayoralty, having followed it closely as a city councillor, and as such is well acquainted with Ljubljana's burning issues. After all, she is also a resident of old Ljubljana, which has become a beautiful city centre in recent years, but looks are not everything. Behind it are many problems that citizens face on a daily basis. . <p/> There are still a number of deliberately inflicted injuries to the Ljubljana organism that will have to be treated, which have been covered up in the past with many "beauty operations". Since we do not want to look for a receiver for Ljubljana in the next regular mayoral elections, we need to elect a good steward in this one - one who will spend money for the benefit of all Ljubljana citizens, who will conscientiously manage the city's land, who will carefully protect the reputation of public companies, who will carry out tenders transparently, who will select contractors responsibly and who will make sure that every subcontractor is paid fairly. The New Slovenia and the Slovenian Democratic Party are behind all of the above, as they have already demonstrated by their performance in the City Council. <p/> Mojca Kucler Dolinar concluded her announcement of her candidacy for Mayor of Ljubljana with her desire to show an alternative to what has happened in Ljubljana so far that is good, effective and puts the people of the capital at the centre. <p/> Dragutin Mate, President of the SDS City Committee, endorsed Dolinar as an excellent candidate who knows Ljubljana very well and has a lot of experience, which is a guarantee that she will be a good steward of Ljubljana and that she will introduce the necessary changes to improve the lives of the citizens of Ljubljana. He stressed the cooperation of both parties in the preparation of the programme. <p/> Anton Kranjc, representative of the NSi City Committee, stressed that Kucler Dolinar is the best choice at this moment because she has experience, she knows how to lead, she knows how to communicate. She knows exactly what is right and what is wrong, and she stands for honesty and sincerity. <p/> City Councillor Anže Logar (SDS) pointed out that Kucler Dolinar has always been an active City Councillor - including as Vice-Chair of the Commission on Mandate Issues, Elections and Appointments, which she now chairs, she supports a lively debate from the point of view of morality and ethics for the benefit of Ljubljana, and would like to see this kind of debate in the City Council as well. In his words, the candidate stands for the power of argument, not for the argument of power. <p/> Minister of Defence Aleš Hojs (NSi) is pleased to see the joint support of the NSi and the SDS. He sees in the candidate the possibility of change for the better and the realisation of the fundamental programme of New Slovenia: "The word is valid. <p/> Minister Dr Žiga Turk (SDS) stressed that Ljubljana deserves a good mayor who is honest, capable and enthusiastic like Kucler Dolinar. Under her leadership, the city can continue what has been good in the past and break with the bad practices of recent mandates.
__label__subjective A lesbian and feminist club in every village Saturday, 14 January 2012 author / ica: IdaH <p/> The enhanced editorial team of Sector Ž will present Vesna Vravnik's new short film A lesbian club in every village, which premiered last December at the Canteen at the Trough. At the same time, the first results of an extensive research on the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia will be presented. The project will be presented by the author of the film and Eva Gračanin, Legebitra Programme Manager. In the second part, we will talk to Vesna Leskošek about the national survey on violence in the private sphere. <p/> Dear feminists. Welcome to the Sector Ž show on this beautiful winter Saturday, which almost smells like the eighth of March. The strengthened and expanded editorial team of the show will present a new short film by Vesna Vravnik, A Lesbian Club in Every Village. The film premiered last December at the Café at the Trough in Metelkova. At the same time, the first results of an extensive research on the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia were presented. The project will be presented by the author of the film and Eva Gračanin, head of the youth programme at the Legebitra Information Centre. The report is prepared by Tea Hvala. In the second part, Ida will talk to Professor Vesna Leskošek from the Faculty of Social Work about the first national survey on violence in the private sphere and in partner relationships, which she conducted together with the co-authors of the document Mojca Urek and Darja Zaviršek. <p/> On 10 December 2011, a presentation of the short film and the research, which were produced within the framework of the Legebitra Information Centre, took place at the Canteen at the Trough. Both concern the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia and represent a courageous attempt to expose their - sorry, our - invisibility. <p/> The documentary Lesbian Club in Every Village was made by Vesna Vravnik, a filmmaker and lesbian activist, who said that she struggled to find enough female interviewees who were willing to expose themselves on camera. It was particularly difficult for girls and women living in smaller Slovenian towns, where the fear of being judged and isolated is particularly well-founded - which is not to say that the situation in Ljubljana is ideal. When asked why she titled the film "A Lesbian Club in Every Village", Vesna replied as follows: <p/> The high school girls who agreed to participate said that the hardest thing to resist is being judged by those who have the most power over them: their parents and teachers. "We don't expose ourselves at school," said a 16-year-old lesbian from Ptuj, "because we are afraid for our grades. There are quite a few of us, but we are afraid of the older teachers. "Another added: "My class teacher called me into her office and told me to choose another school because I had appeared in the Pride Parade - because 'it doesn't go through with them'". The perplexing question of why she did not sue the homophobic class teacher and the public school that acquiesced to her threat is urgent, but unfortunately also rhetorical. Why? Because we have to wonder again who even dares to seek legal remedies in a country where even the Constitutional Court is homophobic. <p/> With Team Dresch, the legendary lesbian band from the USA, we can sarcastically conclude that lesbians are again and still underground. Which does not mean, of course, that we will not circle a big YES for equality before the law in the referendum. <p/> We continue with the presentation of the extensive research conducted by the Legebitra Information Centre, which last year prepared an anonymous online questionnaire on the situation of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia. Since not much is known about their lives, or ours, they wanted to find out what problems we face, what kind of environment we live in and how (if at all) we shape it. The analysis of the data is not yet complete, so here are just a few excerpts from the presentation at the Canteen at the Trough by Eva Gračanin, Head of Legebitra's Youth Programme. As the concept of "non-heterosexual women" is very broad, she first presented the sample of the survey, which included a whole range of gender identities. <p/> The women interviewed were older than those in the film, so it is to be expected that they would have pointed to work, not school, as the most risky environment for coming out. The fact that only 12 of the women came out at work is a testament to the fact that there is a very high chance of losing your job after coming out, or having to "fire" yourself because of the pressures. The data on the political participation and social life of LGBT and all other Others was also telling. Eva Gračanin said the following at the presentation: <p/> Perhaps the fear of public exposure and loneliness is easier to understand if we add one more piece of data to the above: only 20% of the women said they felt completely safe in their environment and family circle, and the same percentage of women said their families did not even know about their sexual orientation. More encouraging was the information about trustworthy friends: 60% of the women have such friends. For those women who are not so lucky, we would like to dedicate the song "Way Out" by German musician Ellen Allien, and we invite all listeners to listen again in May, when we will focus on a more detailed analysis of Legebitra's survey on the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia. <p/> In the second part of the programme, we spoke to Professor Vesna Leskošek from the Faculty of Social Work about the first national survey on violence in the private sphere and in partner relationships, which she conducted together with the co-authors of the document Mojca Urek and Darja Zaviršek. <p/> To summarise: Violence against women, which according to the above-mentioned data is a very real reality in our society, is therefore the result of deep-rooted chauvinism and patriarchal structures. So please, let no one tell me anymore that feminism is a finished project, that today we can all have our own room if that is what we want! <p/> At the end of the programme, we call on all listeners to declare themselves, to declare their rights, because only then will they be able to demand a public space. The programme was produced by Tea Hvala and Ida Hiršenfelder. We will be back on the air of Radio Student on 11 March, when the Red Dawn will be rising on the horizon.

__label__subjective OUT FIT <p/> OUTFIT is a unique workout based on functional training. The special feature is the implementation of outdoor exercise. The mode of exercise and the underlying principles span the different exercise segments and are thus integrated into a whole. Therefore, OUTFIT is a workout where all the most important principles of modern exercise are worked out: coordination, body shaping, gaining fitness, strength, balance, stabilisation, flexibility, etc. It also differs from other functional workouts because of the emphasis on prevention and supervised execution of exercises. The point is to do something good for your body (to achieve as much as possible in a training period, in the best possible way). The workout is suitable for everyone, as it is uniquely adaptable to advanced exercisers as well as beginners. In the fresh air, you're sure to find something to love in 75 minutes of exercise. <p/> The workout consists of a functional warm-up, alphabet run, dynamic stretching. The main part of the challenge is mainly exercises for strength, flexibility, coordination, explosiveness, which are interconnected in an interesting sequence of exercises, separated by intensity or programmed in intervals, for the best possible results and a significant progress of the individual from term to term. This part of the term is about shaping the body and identifying personal weaknesses, with a clear outcome where progress is needed. After the main part of the session, there is stretching and relaxation. In any case, the main focus of the whole workout is to gain general fitness and improve the functionality of the body. <p/> The workout is supervised by the Bodifit team, who are available for advice and consultation before and after the workout. <p/> The aim of the supervision and the design of each training session is to ensure that the exercises are performed correctly and adapted to the individual's performance, fitness and body structure. The latter is often neglected in all the trendy emphasis on functional training and the flood of different exercise offers. However, it should not be forgotten that this is essential for injury prevention and optimal achievement of goals. An effective, fun and unique way to exercise outdoors, Bodifit's novelty is sure to take you by storm and become a permanent fixture during the spring and summer months. <p/> All you have to do is book your place on the date, enjoy the outdoors and surrender to the energy of the excellent Bodifit team, and you'll be eager to keep on exercising.
__label__subjective Knowledge of the local culture is key to entering a new market <p/> Petar Berić, owner and manager of Letalske.si, argues that the success of entering a new market depends on knowledge of the local culture. Ask him for advice at the Young Entrepreneur? Why not! where he will share his views on conquering foreign markets with other guests. <p/> Letalske. si - Petar Berić (Photo source: personal archive) <p/> The development of the idea for Letalske.si happened completely spontaneously. "Originally, the idea was to be one of the first to bring medical tourism to the Slovenian market, where we would offer Slovenian consumers the difference in prices of medical services between Slovenia and Croatia. When the team we had in mind to create the health tourism route fell apart, I started thinking and came to the conclusion that there was a huge potential in the online sale of airline tickets," Petar Berić, general manager of Letalske.si, explains the beginnings of his company. <p/> Recommendations for companies to successfully enter foreign markets ... <p/> And what is the recommendation of an experienced entrepreneurial cat for companies to successfully enter foreign markets? "To be present in foreign markets, it is important to know the local culture or have colleagues who do. It will definitely be easier if you have someone with experience and effective contacts to help you enter a new market. It is also very important to check who you are doing business with, because it is easy to run into unpaid invoices," Berić advises on how to tap into foreign markets. <p/> Multinationals - challenge or threat? <p/> "Multinationals are a challenge to everyone in the market. But there are two sides to the coin, just as multinationals are a threat to us because of their size, we are a threat to them because of our small size and agility, because it is easier for us to reach our customers, listen to them and offer products and support," explains Berić. <p/> "Our target group is all people who travel, have travelled or intend to travel. Basically, anyone who shares a love of travel. We broadly classify these people into two categories: business travellers, whose travel is organised by companies for their employees, and individual travellers, who organise their own travel. "

December is proverbially considered to be the busiest month of the year, but we can say that this weekend, despite the holidays and the resulting higher traffic density on our roads, did not stand out from the average. There was only one road accident resulting in serious injuries and two road accidents, two of which resulted in minor injuries to four occupants. 15 road accidents resulted in damage to property. Over the weekend, 19 drink-drivers were detained. <p/> A traffic accident with serious injuries occurred on Friday at 19:30 on Franja Malgaja Street in Šentjur. A 50-year-old driver was driving a car on Franja Malgaja Street in Šentjur, from the direction of Leona Dobrotinška Street towards II. Bataljona. As he drove his vehicle to the intersection with Gajstova cesta into a sharp right-hand bend, at the end of the bend he drove his vehicle too close to the right-hand edge of the carriageway and collided with a 63-year-old pedestrian, who was walking from the opposite direction, along the left-hand edge of the carriageway. After the collision, the pedestrian, who was wearing dark clothing, fell on the bonnet of the car and hit his head on the windscreen, after which he fell on the road and was seriously injured.

__label__subjective Will Piaggio and Ducati merge? <p/> A motorcycle manufacturer like Ducati probably needs no introduction, nor does Piaggio - which also has Vespa and Moto Guzzi under its umbrella. However, unbelievable as it may sound, rumours have spread in the public today that there is a possibility that the two Italian brands could merge. <p/> News of the possibility of a merger between two important companies in the motorcycle industry comes just a week after speculation that Piaggio was to be sold, which was later denied by the company. The origin of the rumours is currently unknown, but more details can be expected in the coming days. If the merger were to take place, it would mean very strong competition for the Japanese manufacturers in almost all segments, from scooters to super sports motorcycles.

Even with less, we knew how to do it - my first salary was 12 jur and I know even now that my mother told me to keep it for myself and buy what I wanted with it. I bought a sweater (not a home-made one, like I had until then) and cowboy boots, haha. Later on, of course, I paid my mother 'maintenance and contributions for living under the same roof'. <p/> @ haha Aunty, I don't think that 50,000 can be worth anything - it's a lark.

__label__objective 1,50 EUR <p/> Students <p/> 1,50 EUR <p/> Museum of Post and Telecommunications <p/> The renovated Museum of Post and Telecommunications, which operated in the Old Town Castle from 1985 to 2008, is now open in the Polhograje Manor House. The project is the result of many years of cooperation between the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia, Posta Slovenije, Telekom Slovenije and the Technical Museum of Slovenia. <p/> The Museum of Post and Telecommunications houses the renovated and expanded collections History of Post, History of Telecommunications, Women Telephone and Telegraph Operators and the Zhiva's Corner, which is intended for the youngest visitors. On this occasion, we also opened the temporary exhibition The beginnings of mobile telephony in Slovenia. <p/> The Postal History collection shows the development of the post office from prehistoric times to the present day. In four rooms, there are models of postal carriages, reconstructions of post offices and postmen's uniforms from different periods, as well as various means of postal transport (carriage, moped, bicycle). In addition to the above, you can watch excerpts from films on the theme of the post office and an animated film entitled Whose Letter Is It? The relocation of the museum has a special significance for the inhabitants of Polhov Gradec, as the post horn is returning to their town. It was once the property of the Tomšič family from Polhov Gradec, who had a lease on the post office in Polhov Gradec since 1869. <p/> The History of Telecommunications collection pays special attention to women telegraphists and telephonists. The development of telephony and telegraphy helped to create new jobs, which were filled mainly by women. Old telephone sets, teleprinters, telephoto machines and other devices for sending messages over distance are also on display. You can listen to how telephones were used in the past. Since December 2008, visitors can also see and try out the telephone and teleprinter exchange. <p/> The Animal Corner is aimed at the youngest visitors to the museum, who learn about the history of post and telecommunications in the children's corner through games (Find a Pair, Post through Time) and various workshops (making a post horn, a post cap, stamps, etc.).

__label__subjective On Saturday, KK Ivančna Gorica played their first game in their home arena and beat KK Zagorje with a score of 83 : 59. <p/> After a somewhat unexpected defeat in the first round against KK Ježica in Ljubljana, our players took the court determined to keep the victory at home this time. Aljaž Omejec and Jernej Strnad put the home team in the lead right from the start. The score after the first quarter was 19 : 12 for the Ivanske basketball team. In the second quarter, the lead grew a bit more, but there were too many loose balls and mistakes in the game. That is why the home coach was quite vocal several times, asking for a more organised game and consistent execution of the agreed actions. This came to fruition right away in the third quarter, when our players' advantage grew rapidly and the game was routinely brought to an end. This time we can praise all the players, as they all got a chance to play and all of them were among the scorers. Especially pleasing was the fact that Kraljic, a young rookie in the team, hit 4 threes and Jovic hit 2. <p/> This week KK Ivančna Gorica starts the SPAR Cup competition. On Wednesday, 28.10.2015 Tuesday our boys will play their first game against third-placed KK Medvode. The match will take place at 21.00 in Medvode.

__label__objective Watering the lawn <p/> It's the start of the season when lawns need to be well looked after to keep them looking their best through the hot summer days. <p/> It is a misconception that grass needs to be irrigated. It is enough to water it. By irrigating, we are harming the roots to grow deeper into the soil. <p/> An 'underground' sprinkler system that can be set to water the lawn automatically is better. As these sprinklers are below the surface, it is sufficient to water the lawn a few times a week, as the soil retains more moisture than the surface. However, if you do not intend to buy such a system, it is a good idea to check the soil moisture before watering the grass. The best way to do this is to walk on the grass and if you see footprints in the grass, the grass needs watering. You also don't need to water the grass if it has rained for a long time, as the moisture has been retained in the soil. <p/> The best time to water the grass is early in the morning or in the evening, as this reduces the evaporation value. However, experts recommend watering the grass early in the morning (between 5 and 9 am), as evening watering can cause various lawn diseases, as the moisture does not evaporate, creating the perfect conditions for grass diseases to develop. This will keep the soil moist for longer and you will help to save water.

But they are good poke for nerds. The last pitch is a dessert:)... then there is another easier pitch, and another pitch on the NE pitch. We were at the top of the wall after 4h. <p/> Well, that's what happened when Joul announced a joint tour after the previous weekend in White Waters. But to make it not a men's expedition, Pečo invites Kaja from ČAO. <p/> We get to the starting point, where there are already a few parked vehicles, and we realise that the bivouac can be crowded. We load up our 25 kg ruzaks to make our life on the bivouac comfortable and around 8:00 we start up the hill. Because our motto was: "If we have something, we have time. " and because our knees were weak under the heavy rucksacks we walk slowly. Shortly before 11:00 we arrive at the bivouac, where 20 girls are waiting for us. Women's camp Rašice and 4 x AO Academic.

Joule and I head to Veliko Lojtrca, where we have a short time singing loudly the well-known Humar's cover of "I heard three little birds singing...". ":) from Lojtrca we descend to the saddle and climb up the Krniško Trbiško Spit. From there we descend to the west side to the saddle. From here we continue the tour through the tunnel and along the ridge to Velika Bela Spica. <p/> At the bivouac with the rest of AO Litija we have a cold one to celebrate Fit's 40 years of climbing, and then the newcomers head down into the valley. We spend the evening socialising by the fire and baking hot dogs that Fotr has brought us in the evening. On Sunday we wake up to a cold, windy and foggy morning. We cooked coffee after coffee and waited for the weather to improve, because by 11:00 it didn't look any better, so we headed down into the valley and finished the tour together. <p/> Yesterday Mark Pušnik and I climbed this route in the trapezoid of the Velika Draškega vha... The entrance fee for the route is a relatively easy ascent and descent. The route is very beautiful, one of the better five. It has solid rock, lots of wedges. Some sections are really nice and airy. Somewhere in the last third we had a natural shower, which soaked us clean, so we didn't feel hot. We were alone in the wall. We spent 5 hours on the route. I climbed it all in the lead. A really great day in a beautiful direction.

__label__objective Press releases <p/> Yesterday, Monday, 13 February 2012, in the meeting room of the Mayor of the Municipality of Velenje, a meeting of the Council for Improving the Safety of Citizens in the Municipality of Velenje was held. The meeting was chaired by the Chairman of the Council, the Mayor of the Municipality of Velenje Bojan Kontič. <1. Opening hours of bars in the Municipality of Velenje 2. Accommodation of workers who will work on the TEŠ 6 project 3. Under the first agenda item (Opening hours of restaurants in the municipality of Velenje), the Mayor of the Municipality of Velenje, Mr Bojan Kontič, presented the dilemmas that arise in connection with extending the opening hours of restaurants, because on the one hand, citizens want peace and quiet at night, and young people want open restaurants where they can have fun. Extended opening hours are, of course, also important for catering businesses for business reasons. According to the Catering Act, the approval of opening hours for catering establishments is the responsibility of the local authority, which can also withdraw or not grant approval at all. <p/> Catering establishments serving food and drink (restaurants, pubs, cafés, patisseries, cafeterias, snack bars and bars), located in buildings with flats or in buildings in a residential area intended for living and ancillary activities, may only operate between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Operating outside these hours shall be considered as extended opening hours, for which the caterer must obtain the written consent of the local authority. The relevant local authority shall decide on this on the basis of the adopted criteria laid down in the Rules on the criteria for determining the extended opening hours of catering establishments and farms catering in the municipality of Velenje. The Rules lay down the procedures and conditions for obtaining approval for extended opening hours, as well as the procedures and conditions for withdrawing such approval. The Municipal Regulation also obliges caterers to carry out their activities in such a way that they do not disturb the environment. <p/> According to Alenka Rednjak, Head of the Investment and Development Office, the Municipality of Velenje is in the process of amending the municipal regulations to provide that the opinion of the district or local community in whose area the restaurant is located is to be taken into account when issuing a consent for extended opening hours. <p/> Mayor Bojan Kontič informed the attendees that the Velenje Police Station had submitted two proposals to the Velenje Municipality for the cancellation of the extended opening hours, namely for Bar Max Klub, s.p. (Šaleška cesta 3, Velenje), where the opening hours are Monday to Thursday from 10 pm to 1 am and on Fridays and Saturdays from 10 pm to 5 am, and for Pit Stop bar (Celjska cesta 2, Velenje), where the bar is open 24 hours. According to the Velenje Police Station, the above-mentioned bars have had to intervene several times due to public order violations, including fights, and occasionally the detention of offenders. <p/> Drago Alenc, Commander of the Velenje Police Station, explained that due to the extended opening hours of the restaurants, problems and violations occur mainly in the vicinity of the Red Hall, where the restaurants are open until 3 or 5 am. Police officers note that after the closure of the Red Hall, guests go to the Pit Stop bar, which is across the road by the petrol station. For the safety of pedestrians on the road, police officers are repeatedly carrying out enhanced traffic controls on this stretch of road, as pedestrians are crossing the road in this part of the carriageway, which is not illuminated and in a place where there is no marked pedestrian crossing. Police officers note that many pedestrians are under the influence of alcohol. The Velenje Police Station considers that the frequent violations, which are mostly recorded at night on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, are a problem for public order, traffic and general safety in this part of the city. <p/> The Director of the Municipal Administration, Andreja Katič, pointed out that the request for more police officers should be re-submitted to the line ministry. <p/> The Mayor of Velenje, Bojan Kontič, said that on the basis of the proposal of the Velenje Police Station to cancel the extended opening hours of the Max Klub, s.p. bar and the Pit Stop bar, the Velenje Municipality had cancelled the consent for the extended opening hours of the above-mentioned establishments.<p/> The Mayor of Velenje, Bojan Kontič, said that the Municipality of Velenje had also cancelled the opening hours of the Max Klub, s.p. bar and the Pit Stop bar. The owner of the Pit stop bar appealed against the revocation of the consent and, following the new measures, provided more adequate security for the bar and was granted a new consent for extended opening hours by the municipality. However, Bar Max Klub, s.p., only has consent for extended opening hours at weekends, when concerts are held in the bar. <p/> The mayor pointed out that the municipality had not yet made a final decision on the issue of consents for extended opening hours for the bars in the Red Hall Velenje, as they wanted to find a compromise with the owners of the bars so that they could be open at night and at the same time would not violate the Act on Public Order and the Ordinance on General Order in the Municipality of Velenje. <p/> Under the second item on the agenda (Accommodation of workers to be employed in the TEŠ 6 project), the Director of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant Unit 6 Project, Mr. Miran Žgajner presented the project, which represents a new chapter in Slovenia's energy supply and is currently Slovenia's largest energy investment. It is a modern, highly efficient unit that will gradually replace the existing units. He stressed that Unit 6 is a replacement and not an additional generating facility, which is being built to provide more environmentally friendly electricity at a competitive price. The construction of Block 6 does not represent an additional encroachment on the site, as it will be built on the existing site. Of course, all the measures required by the Environmental Impact Report will also be implemented during construction. The construction of the 600 MW Block 6 will take until 2014. <p/> Mayor Bojan Kontič pointed out that the members of the Council, who act as a preventive body in this environment, would like to know in particular the number of workers who will be living in the valley during the construction of the block. In this way, the institutions could also prepare themselves for a larger number of clients. <p/> Mag. Mr Žgajner said that during the most intensive works, there would be between 1,500 and 1,800 workers on site, most of them foreigners. Those responsible for the construction of the unit have further increased security on site, as each worker will now have his or her own photo identification card. This will limit free movement on the site and ensure that workers can be properly identified off-site. In the coming days, Termoelektrarna Šoštanj will also conclude an agreement with PV Invest on mutual cooperation in organising accommodation for workers. <He added that road traffic to the construction site will be routed in such a way as to minimise disruption, and attempts will be made to bring as much material as possible by rail and at night. <p/> Mayor Bojan Kontič stressed the importance of the good cooperation of the Velenje Police Station and the Velenje Health Centre with those responsible for the Block 6 project. This is also due to the good and timely information provided to the police officers about the mode of transport of the cargo. The police officers ensure the safety of both our citizens and foreigners who come to work here. <p/> The Director of the Velenje Health Centre, Jože Zupančič, is negotiating with those in charge at Alstom about the provision of health services for foreigners coming to work in the valley. He said that the health centre will make sure that an emergency medical team will be available as close as possible to the construction site during the operating hours. A new doctor has also been recruited at the Šoštanj Health Station and will be available to deal with the expected increase in the number of patients. <p/> The Block 6 Project Director concluded by stressing that if the Government of the Republic of Slovenia does not adopt the Act on the State Guarantee for the Loans for Block 6 of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant by tomorrow, 15 February 2012, the Block 6 project may also come to a halt. <p/> Under Other Business, the Director of the Centre for Social Work Velenje, Zlatka Srdoč Majer, presented current information on the Centre's activities. It is encouraging to note that recently there have been fewer incidents of domestic violence and fewer applications for social assistance. However, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the new social organisation will have to wait until the end of March. By then, they expect to have issued all the decisions for 3 140 applicants.
__label__objective Marko Košir FROM THE IRON ROAD TO... The railway in philately, art, music, film, etc. published 24 May 2010 This book shows the influence of the railway on the things people do for pleasure and for a short time. Sometimes it is also a way for some people to earn a living and make our lives better. <p/> Chapter 1 gives a brief history of stamps with railway motifs. This is followed by images of stamps from Europe and the rest of the world. The stamps of the former Yugoslavia and Slovenian stamps after 1991 are presented in detail. All the locomotives on the stamps are additionally described, and I have added to the stamps their philatelic and catalogue value. Special mention is made of some of the steam locomotives of the Slovenian Railways (SŽ) and the Ocean locomotive, with an account of important events in Maribor during the construction of the Vienna-Trieste line. The chapter concludes with a selection of some famous steam locomotives of my choice. <p/> Chapter 2, after a brief introduction, presents in detail Honegger's composition Pacific 231. The composition is interesting because its origin is linked to a mistake made by the composer. This is followed by a short presentation of some of the Pacific series locomotives from France and the rest of the world. <p/> The third chapter shows the link between railways and poetry, or rather the influence of railways on the creation of 'railway' poems. The poems selected are Prešeren's On the Railway Road and Župančič's By Train. This is followed by a description of the locomotives that may have pulled the train that Župančič rode through Gorenjska on his way to Paris. Here again, the content of Župančič's poem does not correspond to the situation on the railway at the time of its composition in 1905. <p/> The chapter on railways and painting, after an introduction showing some famous paintings of railways, is dedicated to the pioneer of the expert treatment of the history of railways in Slovenia and the man most responsible for the establishment of the museum collection and the Railway Museum in Ljubljana. This is the academic painter Stane Kumar. It also describes where overconfidence in oneself, underestimating others and ignoring historical and professional facts in the name of artistic freedom can lead. This is exactly what happened to Stane Kumar. <p/> The last chapter describes the Bohinj railway, its history, important buildings, the landscape and people along it, and two famous locomotives from the past. <p/> An appendix explains some of the philatelic and railway terms that appear in the book. The wheel arrangements of steam locomotives from all over the world are thoroughly explained. A schematic of a steam locomotive and a data table of all the locomotives in the book are also added. In addition to the basic data, the table contains detailed information for those who are more familiar with the subject. (From the author's preface.) <p/> Brief introduction of the author. Markoš Košir, born in 1946. During his career, he worked for TAM and TVM in Maribor as a designer of commercial vehicles and buses from 1973 to 2009. He was a member of the JUS Federal Commission for Commercial Vehicles and a member of the UN and EU Commission for Technical Regulation at the Ministry of Transport of the Republic of Slovenia. He has participated in several professional meetings at home and abroad. Since his early days he has been a great lover and connoisseur of everything related to music life at home and abroad. He is a writer of professional material and has his own researcher number 15612 in COBISS.

__label__subjective Are systematic examinations really compulsory? <p/> At the Association for Freedom of Choice, we are receiving an increasing number of indignant letters from parents informing us of the unacceptable practice of paediatricians and school doctors in cases where a child is not brought for a systematic check-up. Some parents are even threatened with reporting to the CSD for "neglecting" their child, while others are told that they will no longer be their doctor of choice if they do not come for a check-up (even if the child is healthy! ). Clearly, there is increasing pressure on parents from paediatricians and some state institutions, which is not least reflected in increased dissatisfaction and resistance from parents. <p/> The health centre is threatening one family directly in writing - without any legal basis! - that if they do not bring their baby for a systematic check-up, the Social Work Centre will be sent to their door. In the accompanying document, I am sending you an official clarification from the Ministry of Health (from January 2011), which makes it clear that systematic examinations are a RIGHT in Slovenia and that they are NOT MANDATORY. <p/> What is the situation with these systematic examinations now, are they compulsory (ZZVZZ) or not (statements of the Ministry of Health)? Do you get the CSD by the scruff of the neck in this country if you don't go for such a check-up? Where and why, who gives them this right to send the CSD over parents and de facto impose systematics as compulsory? Are such threats and pressures from doctors and the state permissible? <p/> We believe that this is an intensive increase of pressure on parents beyond all permissible limits, and therefore civil society movements are considering a form of public protest against the intensification of repression against parents by paediatricians and the state. If we fail to stop this - will soon every parent who fails to turn up with their child for a systematics session receive threats or even a CSD hearing? <p/> This practice by paediatricians and other actors in the health sector is contrary to legislation and guidelines for good practice for paediatricians, as well as to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which the Republic of Slovenia is in flagrant breach of by failing to regulate this area by law. <p/> Article 18 emphasises that the primary responsibility and care for the growth and development of the child in all respects belongs to the parents (or in special cases, legal representatives), and the best interests of the child are the primary parental concern. In order for parents to be able to achieve this goal, States Parties must provide them with appropriate support and establish institutions and services that parents can use to achieve this goal. Article 24 highlights the right of the child to enjoy the highest standard of health and to have access to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health. It is the role of the State to ensure access to these facilities and technologies and to ensure that all segments of society, especially parents and children, are informed about these options, have access to education about them and to basic knowledge about child health and nutrition, the benefits of breastfeeding, hygiene and a clean environment, and disaster prevention. Nowhere in the Convention does it say that families must submit to compulsory procedures in the area of preventive health and medical examinations and interventions. The fact is that, because of pressure from paediatricians, a good number of Slovenian parents are already going abroad for check-ups, mainly to Austria. There, many parents are even asked what they have come for, because the child is healthy and, in their opinion, would not need so many examinations. More proof that something is very wrong in Slovenia. <p/> It is also a fact that recently the CSDs have taken children away from some families for similar reasons. Will we parents have to fear our own country in future? If you find this topic interesting, we invite you to contact our association for more information, the contacts are listed below. Above all, the Ministry of Health owes the Slovenian public an immediate clarification on all this.
__label__subjective EXPERIENCE THE UNIVERSE! <p/> On the evening of 7 August 2017, we had the opportunity to observe a partial lunar eclipse. We went to Kurešček above the Ljubljana Marshes.

__label__objective Are there better scholarships in our future? <p/> On Wednesday 13 October, the one-month public debate on the Scholarships Bill started, with a number of new features. <p/> According to the new law, a student will be able to receive several grants at the same time, but if the sum of the two grants is more than €400, his/her state grant will be reduced or stopped. The grant could also be paid when a student repeats a year for legitimate reasons (health, parenthood, social situation) and when extending the status. The census threshold for obtaining a state scholarship will be increased (currently it is between 65 and 70 minimum wage) from the current €400 to €600, which should lead to more scholarships. The basic state grant should also increase. <p/> For Zois scholarships, the eligibility conditions would be tightened: currently, a candidate must meet one of the following conditions, but now he or she will have to demonstrate success and talent. <p/> (The Public Fund for Human Resources Development and Scholarships will decide on Zois scholarships for upper secondary and first year undergraduate students by the end of October, and for upper secondary and postgraduate students in November. ) <p/> Katja Šoba, President of the ŠOS, said that until these scholarships are realised, they will be questioned, as there have been too many such promises in the past that have not materialised.
__label__subjective US urges Romania to defend independent judiciary <p/> Bucharest, 11 January (STA) - The United States today urged Romania to defend the rule of law and expressed concern about attacks by politicians on the independent judiciary. Victoria Nuland, US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, criticised the Romanian authorities and warned that "an independent judiciary is essential for a strong democracy" during a visit to Bucharest. <p/> After years of total impunity, several high-ranking Romanian politicians, including former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, have been convicted of corruption and landed in prison in recent years. This shows, according to analysts, that the independence of the judiciary in this Balkan country, which has been an EU member since 2007, is strengthening, albeit slowly. <p/> "You have made great strides forward, especially in the last five years, and I call on all Romanians (...) to fight even harder to defend the independence of the judiciary and to keep it out of politics," the high-ranking US guest stressed today in Bucharest after a meeting with Romanian President Traian Basescu and Foreign Minister Titus Corlatean, the French news agency AFP reports. <p/> The Austrian news agency APA adds that the Romanian authorities, expecting harsh words, had already warned the US before the visit not to raise the issue of Romanian justice and reminded that Romania is not an American colony. But this did not seem to stop Nuland. <p/> Her words referred to the Romanian Parliament's attempt to provide a kind of "super-immunity" to MPs and local politicians by amending the Penal Code and the law on amnesties and pardons. This would also protect incumbent politicians from possible corruption charges. In addition, politicians already convicted of corruption could be pardoned, APA writes. <p/> The US immediately branded the attempt at the end of December as "a step away from transparency and the rule of law", while the EU and several of its members, including Germany and France, also expressed concern. In the end, Bucharest only caved in under pressure and postponed the adoption of the law until February, but it has not yet been abandoned. <p/> Further discontent was caused by statements by Socialist Prime Minister Victor Ponta, a sworn opponent of the conservative President Basescu, in which he accused the special prosecutor for the fight against corruption, DNA, and the integrity body, ANI, of being subject to the "Basescu regime" and of ruling unfairly. Last week, the Prime Minister even compared the recent second corruption conviction of Nastase to the imprisonment of opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko in Ukraine. <p/> The situation in Romania was most acute last year, when Ponta's centre-left coalition tried to oust Basescu by referendum. In attempting to do so, it, among other things, blatantly interfered with the independence of the Romanian Constitutional Court.
__label__subjective Today, people do not appreciate, accept or respect the experience and wisdom of the great thinkers who revealed the secret of the universe and their all-embracing love. All religious principles, with the minor exception of a few, can be reconciled and set off against each other very easily. The various rituals of the different religions glorify and worship one and the same God by different names. <p/>In every age, God has sent prophets to all nations in order to restore peace and goodwill among men. In our times, many religions have spread all over the world, but at the same time they have lost the sense of brotherly and sisterly bonding among people. We urgently need to restore harmony. All exalted human beings are images of God. In the kingdom of God there is only one social class and all belong to only one nation - the divine nation. You must understand the habits and beliefs of others more deeply. Only then will you be able to feel the presence of God with a pure mind and a loving heart.
__label__objective The Day After <p/> Almost no festive party goes by without consequences. To help you get through them, here are some useful tips for the "day after". <p/> A day of rest and recharging usually follows a day of partying. Recovering from a wild night will be faster if you start the day with fresh fruit and plenty of tea or freshly squeezed orange juice. This will ensure adequate hydration and vitamin intake. A visit to the sauna is also recommended to relax and cleanse your body. <p/> Tradition has it that the day after the pumpkin party, a dish of sauerkraut is a good idea, as it is rich in vitamin C. If you are not keen on cooking, you can reheat ready-made yoghurt, sarma or other restorative stews. But make sure you give yourself enough rest for new festive ventures.

__label__subjective New Jersey with a new additional source of solar energy <p/> In Bordentown, New Jersey, USA, a rooftop solar system was installed to cover parking spaces. Alpha Energy, a company in Bellingham, Washington, which manufactures photovoltaic energy systems, has built a real small solar power plant that will generate more than one million kilowatt hours of energy per year. This energy will be used to light up the car parks of the used car dealers who have made this investment, and will also allow them to offer their customers free plug-ins for their electric cars. Most importantly, of course, they will be feeding this solar energy into New Jersey's energy grid. <p/>This cleaner technology investment will save 860 tonnes of carbon dioxide, the same amount of energy that would have been generated from non-renewable sources such as coal, gas or oil. The entire system generates solar energy using more than 5 000 solar panels and covers an area of 9700 m2.
__label__subjective Honda's high-flying five-year plan <p/> Forecast. Honda has announced that it plans to double car production over the next five years, with a large number of new models expected to come to market, including in segments where it is currently absent. <p/>Honda's CEO Takanobu Ito said a few days ago that Honda plans to increase production to six million vehicles a year over the next five years from the current 3.1 million, with a number of new models planned, including in segments where it has not been present so far. <p/> Honda is therefore expecting a lot from the all-new generation of the Jazz, as well as from its smaller brother, the Brio, which will be aimed primarily at developing markets and will be a cheaper version of the aforementioned Jazz. To boost production, Honda plans to build new plants, one of which will be opened in Mexico by 2014, and will also focus on the Chinese market, where it plans to launch a maximum of 10 new models. <p/> The fate of the Accord in the European markets is still unknown, as Honda is not confident about the sales and profitability of the model in the old continent (photo: Honda) <p/> Much fewer new models in Europe <p/> While it is not yet known which of the new models will also enter the markets of the old continent, among the models announced are, in addition to the aforementioned brio and jazz, a smaller suv based on the latter, as well as a smaller sedan, which will be a replacement for the current Honda city. <p/> A sporty civica rally car has also been announced, which will, as usual, be given the Type-R nameplate, but enthusiasts will still have to wait until 2015 to get their hands on it. Much more numerous in terms of sales, however, will surely be the announcement of the new generation Accord, whose production for European markets is still in question for the time being, since the Accord has been a loss-making car in most European markets over the last few years, thanks to the strong yen. The same (unknown) fate in the European markets for the time being also awaits the A0 segment model, which will be called N-ONE in the Japanese markets. Among the models announced, we must not forget the NSX sports coupé, as well as the new sports roadster based on last year's EV-STER concept study. <p/> For the US markets, the acura RLX is also confirmed for the Los Angeles show in November, and is expected to arrive in Europe later in the form of the honda legend. For 2015, Honda has also announced a production version of the fuel cell model for European markets, not the FCX Clarity, but an all-new and significantly cheaper model. <p/> The Honda NSX is due to arrive in showrooms very soon, and we can also expect a new sporty roadster based on last year's EV-STER concept study, as well as a redesigned CR-Z hybrid coupé (photo: Honda). <p/> So, according to the announcements, the future of Honda on European soil in particular is still rather unclear, and not necessarily as rosy as it has been for quite a few years now.
__label__subjective Text taken from the novel Three Reasons, page 220. The computer displays images inaudibly and lights flash on the titanium case. Where the light burns long at night, there are ideas. And that, we know, is wrong, heretical ... and dangerous ... <p/> There are no powerful plots in the novel, and it is nothing like The Da Vinci Code, I say to those who, like the writer, had trouble with that book and barely made it to the end. There is a chronological account of the various events in The Three Reasons. It is more like this. And in fact, in film, if you like, and literature, there are few things as dramatic as real life. Even though we all know life, it still tells us something new and special every day. And it is always more interesting to write about. The novel Three Reasons is a humorous slice of a year in the life of a mother of two Lilliputians, a wife and an interesting young woman. <p/> The story introduces different people through a first-person narrative (Xenia's). The negative Vlasta, the careerist Darja, the smeared Nika and the unhappy Veronika, Xenia's family and a wider circle of acquaintances through whom she paints her unusual images. Unlike many other authors, she takes refuge in reality at critical points, or so I understood her. This is very unusual. The author does not come across as naïve at all, I would rather say fresh and youthful. Despite her experience, she has, in my opinion, almost too much confidence in her environment and in other people. How damn wrong she is, she is yet to find out. Her whole generation will find that out. There can be no doubt about that. She is only distrustful of her partner, who probably of all people loves and respects her the most. That does not surprise me one bit. All the women I know are like that. <p/> Without a single exception. :) <p/> There is humour in Three Reasons, too. Good and beautifully written. We can laugh at Alexandra in many places. I found myself laughing the most when she describes the passionate lovemaking where Xenia and Marko have earned their butts on their heads on the same shelf. They switched positions, there is no doubt about that. Whether it was when her phone fell into a puddle or when she met her boyfriend from the machine. <p/> This is how she describes her weighing and makes fun of the fashion commandments. With the rarely seen self-irony of a woman with a slightly damaged self-esteem, which at the end very smoothly turns into a sympathetic sarcasm: <p/> I stripped naked to make the result as accurate as possible. I went to pee earlier, so that I wouldn't suffer at the expense of a few unnecessary grams. And then the fatal step. The thin plate seemed to be groaning under my weight. I blinked, told myself once again that the result didn't matter because I'd fix it soon anyway, then opened my eyes and looked down. 69 kilos. The dreaded seven was damn close. My stomach clenched, I immediately got down and then stepped on the scales again. Don't ever do that unless you're too skinny! I jumped down like I'd been burnt by nettles and resisted the instinctive urge to try again - maybe the result would be more normal after all, like a cute 62. It was clear that the scale was sensing my torment and deliberately adding salt to my tired bones. <p/> Through self-irony, she also makes a rueful mockery of a world in which Barbies are the ideal of feminine beauty, and things like that. <p/> Those Barbies you can talk to like you can talk to the telly ... :) <p/> 3. <p/> Language is special. It's self-described and not inspired by anyone. It's a little bit like Gosposvetsko polje, it's just more modern and quite unusual. It is apparent that Aleksandra also writes poetry, quite well, in the opinion of those in the know, to put it casually. The language is innovative in describing contemporary things and interspersed with less familiar words for decoration and delicacy. Sometimes even too much, even with paediatric and other medical terms. I did not understand it yet, but I studied medicine. Don't believe me? I really did, only that was a long time ago, when I was in the seventh grade of an eight-year school. Even then I was very talented, although not much appreciated, and only one classmate had any understanding for my studies. I read the medical encyclopaedia, all the entries on A and B. And I had the symptoms of all those diseases. Except for white current, or I didn't know how to recognise it in the first year. So I dropped out of that study. For health reasons, mostly. :) The structure of the text itself is also quite strange. The beginning and the end of the novel are symmetrical, the same words are repeated. The mantra of the three reasons appears throughout the text, which is why it's like a kind of theme or a literary musical theme. There are other structural and stylistic elements, but they are not the most essential for an amateur's experience and understanding of the content. That is why I leave them to the experts, so that they have something to write about. <p/> It is quite a good text. Will it win any prizes? I am thinking. Hardly. Just because it is written by a young woman, it doesn't stand much of a chance. Although ... Still, there's something going on with these awards. Something heretical. Something they're stirring up over there now, bossing and changing. That's good. At least that's what I was thinking on the Rožnik, listening to the cute Combine singing a song. The lyrics were written by Moss, in case you didn't know. That Vojnović gets more votes than Jančar? That is something! For Vojnović, of course. A little less for Jančar. That is heretical and different from what it was. So that the faces in the boxes sometimes get mixed up. That is also the point. To have something fresh for the daily news and not just last year's news. I have not read these two books to this day. I have no time. Except for a little bit in the sublist. If anything, I prefer to read Lainsztek and Mazzini. Or poetry, if I don't have anything more clever to do. <p/> For all these reasons, I hope that Alexandra has a chance with Three Reasons. She could do with some kind of prize, probably more than the aforementioned authors. And no one would be too much of a fool. They wouldn't have anything to bullshit about, at least in my opinion. There are more than three reasons for that, too. And her thirtieth anniversary is coming up soon, because she's in quite a hurry. Already at the age of four ... :) <p/> I would also like to draw attention to a particular atmosphere that emanates from the text. It seems Bulgakovian to me, although I can't explain it very well. There are no communist apparatchiks, and nobody's head is cut off by a tram. But there is something there, if not I would not feel it. Only, I cannot say it very well, because I am just a lover of literature and I am writing my opinion here mainly for you to pick up the book. <p/> That is all it is really about.
__label__subjective Well, come to my house for a visit...my child is currently a meat eater, so I'm almost worried, she's not interested in anything else...she eats sausages out of her sandwich, throws vegetables on the floor for the dogs, leaves potatoes and rice on the plate, and she happily munches on sausages and steak. And she has everything her heart desires at her disposal : <p/> +1 She wants no fruit, no pasta, no potatoes, no vegetables, no fruit ... And his mother eats almost only vegetables and fruit, and his father only starches. <p/> On a neighbouring forum someone was being persuaded not to buy a mix. I quote the part of the text that speaks against buying the mix: <p/> "...both cavalier and pug breeds have heart problems and that no matter if the dog is a mix or pedigree that you have to know that treatment is expensive, I have a cavalier with pedigree and we have been keeping him alive for 3 and a half years now only with medication, how much did all the visits to the vet, all the medicines cost me, and I don't add it up, but probably about 2000 euros, and probably more, so buying a dog is the cheapest, but if you buy a dog from a proven breeder you will know that the dog will start to have heart failure at the age of say 8, 9 years..." <p/> So why should I buy a dog with a pedigree? Why already? This writing certainly discourages me from doing so. <p/> Maybe you know which tests are mandatory for pugs and cavaliers for breeding? One, several,...? (I really don't know, that's why I'm asking) <p/> but if you buy a dog from a proven breeder you will know that the dog will start to have heart failure at say 8, 9 years old, and I know of a case of a non-breeding cavalier who has a grade 4 heart murmur at 4 years old (which mine had at 8 years old). <p/> ALL cavaliers have heart problems. If you buy from a proven breeder, problems will appear at 8,9 years, if not they can appear much earlier. <p/> (it's half a question why a person would want a dog that has heart problems from the start, but ok, to each his own) <p/> @salad Ever since user 007 asked a simple question on the "neighbouring forum", in the next 3-4 pages, the "genealogical automaton" kicked in and uncontrollably started spewing the same learned phrases, which are TOTALLY not the answer to the question asked, and started to savagely rape the person with its logic, which doesn't allow for a different opinion. Unfortunately, the "automated slaves" of the genealogy lobby are also on this forum, and here too they impose their beliefs on the users. <p/>Why? It is just a problematic breed in certain health aspects. Why hide it? I mean, if one paragraph is taken out of context, it's despicable anyway. This dog, if I am not mistaken, is about 9 years old. And it is quite right to warn a person who does not know what he is buying that both breeds can be risky, especially if the parent dogs have not had heart health tests. <p/> And this mix would do nothing to improve health, quite the opposite. And if it has already been used and the dogs are not under control, there is no need for the "breeder" to deceive the potential guardians of the calf puppies with silence. Or I suppose it is possible that he has told them, but given the general reaction, I don't think he has. <p/> Are you both saying that the problems should not be talked about? Given that traceability is possible, they can be talked about at all, but not in the case of a mixed breed, which doesn't mean it will be healthy <p/> And to be left in the dark... it is precisely through controlled breeding that things can improve. But without control, without tests, preferably with the first one around the corner, you really can't reduce the incidence of certain defects. Tests are definitely not everything, but they can help with many things, and there is always a risk. We are talking about living beings, not carbon fibre <p>An answer that tells a person what the characteristics and needs of BOTH breeds are and that's enough. But the man has been given a "lecture" which he did not commission and is not prepared to pay for. He pointed this out a couple of times and then gave up. <p/> To me, he looked like someone who wanted to buy the cheapest possible gift, and in general he got very comprehensive answers (although he did not expect them to be comprehensive) and even surprisingly he did not just get lessons about not buying animals as gifts. You can only make a conclusion from what is written... what the heck... that's the way it is on the forum... <p/> Yes. Functional illiteracy and/or intolerance of dissent. Unfortunately, it's not just like that on the forum. <p/> There are already too many of those. They were created when standardisation started, which if I'm not mistaken was in the Victorian era. You win ;-) Everyone has their own views on the world, animals etc. You don't have any. <p/> I would like to ask you something else. Maybe somebody lives in Vic. We could get together sometime and go I don't know to PST or the carob. We moved here recently so we don't know any or very few. We always need company:-) <p/> You know what saddens me the most? E.g. this: http://www.pesjanar.si/forum/index.php?topic=151.90 And right on the neighbouring forum, and elsewhere, they support so called "controlled pedigree breeding". What is controlled here? And this is not an isolated case, there are many, too many. Are they to be believed? They don't convince me... <p/>These defects are now being diagnosed, but that doesn't mean they weren't there before. <p/> Before, when you asked why you didn't have a dog anymore, they said, "He was old", and he was maybe a little over seven years old... One of the examples I have encountered in my life... And what do you say to them? (it was a village mixed breed) I am not saying that mixed breeds are more or less sick, but that you can't conclude from the number of visits to the vet how healthy they are. Because the one above must have died of old age, and yes, when you talk about the breed, there is the possibility of finding out a bit more about the history of the previous breeds, which is unfortunately not possible with mixed breeds, because nobody knows anything, unless they are all from the same village and people know them.... In that case they are usually much more closely related than some pedigree dogs. (villageinbriding) <p/> Hudma, he himself wrote that he was buying a dog as a gift, but he was actually looking for a pug...really gross illiteracy. Otherwise, it has nothing to do with this topic... Do you approve of buying a living creature for someone who has no idea what is in store for him? No one deserves that, not the giver and not the animal. If the recipient is younger, his parents are he he he <p/>salad, are you sad about the ultrasound? Aren't you in favour of the unsupervised? <p/> Yes, because it's clear to me that there are certain things you just don't want to know ....on the neighbouring forum all the "evidence" has been carefully deleted, that's how it's done here, I'm afraid. I will quote the following text: <p/> " I am contacting you because I would like to warn potential buyers of my experience of [name and surname deleted at the request of the author, and the name of the kennel], which has been anything but pleasant. <p/> Around Christmas 2009 my partner and I bought a little bull terrier from her, who was just over 2 months old at the time. After much cajoling to hand over the papers, we went to her a couple of months later to get the pedigree, and then she asked, a little strangely, how much our Oscar was drinking, because one male from that litter had already died because his kidneys had failed because he was licking the salty snow by the roadside (which is, of course, a big stupid thing to do!). While nothing was clear to us at the time, we soon found out why she was asking such strange questions - we took the puppy to the vet, who diagnosed congenital chronic kidney failure and told us that his days were numbered. We informed [name removed] and asked her what she was going to do about it. She offered to buy another dog for a 'symbolic' price, but we refused and asked for a refund. She promised to send a reply by e-mail, but nothing happened for two months. In the meantime we met others who had bought dogs from the same litter and warned them about the disease. It turned out that out of the 6 dogs from the litter, 2 were already dead and 2 had severe kidney damage. I have no information on the other two. When we asked [name deleted] why she had not informed any of us that there might be something wrong with the dogs, she replied that she did not want to panic. Even after we had informed her about Oscar (so 2 puppies were already dead and one was sick), she did not warn anyone. <p/> As she had not emailed anything for two months, we called her and after many calls she did come back. In the meantime, Oskar had already been euthanised. When asked why she had not replied as promised, she said she had not had time. When my partner asked her if she was making a fool of him for not having had 10 minutes in two months to write an e-mail, she told him that if he meant to be rude, she would hang up. When he told her that Oskar was gone, she first asked "How is he gone?", but when he explained that we had had him euthanised, she was all amazed, as if she had not known that he was ill, and as if we had had the dog put to sleep just for a bit of a joke. And again she promised to send an e-mail. Today it is 14 days since that call, and I have not heard from her. I understand that puppies have unforeseen health problems, but for her to persistently proclaim herself a great dog lover, then hide the facts and react in this way to the fact that more than half of the litter is seriously ill or already dead, and yet tell no one and persistently avoid contact, to me clearly shows her attitude to animals. <p/> I would therefore caution anyone who may wish to buy a puppy from [name of kennel deleted, at the request of the author] to think carefully about it, because, while everything seems fine on their side, our experience and that of others who have bought puppies from this litter suggests otherwise. " <p/> Will something be clearer now? This is how it is in the St. Florian Valley....this is what is supported here! <p/> Yes, my sorrow! You can find scum everywhere. And what doesn't convince you? Are you going to lump everything together because of some bad breeders? And purebreds without pedigree convince you, huh? The ones who haven't had a single test. Hehehe, you're the one who should believe the tests you're going to get from a breeder rather than from a home breeder! <p/>What to do with all the xy tests if such breeders are breeding? But nobody dares to comment on that? Why does such a breeder continue to breed? Why is he being advertised where they are the most vocal about supertruper honestly controlled pedigree breeding? Considering the number of "renegades" in slo, I doubt I can get a better (healthier) pedigree dog than a mix. And no, I don't trust our breeders. And I don't know what's funny here. <p/> Well, with all the xy tests (mandatory + desirable) that a breeder would show you, you could see that he actually cares about the health of the bitch, the puppies and the breed itself! Because if he didn't, he wouldn't even go to do them. A quasi breeder will never show you xy tests and you don't buy a dog from one! Simpl ko pasulj! <p/> I find your way of thinking funny. Let's say the bitch is having a fight with the neighbour's NO. She has a heart problem for example (when you come to see her she looks pure awesome) and he's a poor bastard who can barely walk and he's only 4 years old. You'd rather take the dog from me, because....... the puppies will be bursting with health because they are mixed-breeds? I can tell you fairy tales, but the one who has done the 5 tests has the proof <p/> Andreja, are you making fun of me???? QUOTE: Greetings, I am in the process of buying a dog, not for me, but I still need some advice. I am deciding to buy a pug, not a purebred, this one is a mix between a pug and a cavalier king charles. I would like to know if this dog is a lot of work, I have read a lot of things on the net, some people say that it is necessary to clean the fold every day, to comb it, that it is a special food, fruit... and that it is a quiet family dog, which is mainly intended for the house, I would like to have some more opinions from the owners who have this type of dog, thank you very much! <p/> I underlined his question, now you tell me where he is asking about my/your/our opinion on giving a dog away. PLEASE? The man is asking about the character traits and idiosyncrasies of a pug and a cavalier. BUT NO???? But is it so difficult to write a couple of answers to a SIMPLE question? <p/> The guy wanted to buy a dog as a gift. That's not how it's done. Regardless, he got the answers to his questions. He just didn't like them and didn't want to see them accordingly. He was told that he would not buy a pug (whose qualities he was interested in) nor a mix, but a cross between the two dogs. For which no one can predict what he will take from which parent (they are very different breeds in character and structure, the only thing they have in common is that they are not large (like crossing a Springer Spaniel with a Mastiff and wanting to know what you will get out). He was told that both breeds were medically demanding. Why? because most of the problems that afflict these two breeds are due to their physique. This problem is not due to standards, but both breeds have had this problem since God knows when - pugs are very old dogs, cavaliers a little less so, but both were around long before x-rays, ultrasounds...Be that as it may, the problems of cavaliers are such that it is difficult to weed them out of breeding, because there are no simple genetic or other tests to detect them before they occur. They do appear quite late in life. Now.... these problems are not hidden and are common knowledge. Anyone who nevertheless chooses to breed will look for parents who have their hearts checked regularly and those who have not had syringomyelia in a noticeable form in their ancestors. This is possible exclusively in pedigrees. Those who want a less risky breed will take a cockerel (which, unfortunately, is not so fancy). So the guy got the answer that a mix of these two breeds would be a risky purchase and that there was a high probability that the recipient would leave a hefty pile of money at the vets. OK? <p/> Hahaha oh how it was also conditioned by the standards (that the characteristics in the offspring are VERY similar from characteristics to looks). Quote from wiki:The King Charles changed drastically in the late 17th century, when it was interbred(Means to breed within a single family or strain, so as to produce particular characteristics in the offspring) with flat-bred breeds. I created a bunch of new problems that nowadays complicate this breed but not only that mostly everything. Not to say that there weren't problems before, but in very minor ways. How many breeds have problems with joints, breathing, massive eyelids to congenital diseases like chronic kidney failure,etc. People this is sick what is happening to dogs and don't give me crap how some xy tests can solve them because they can't. <p/> If a dog is a butcher (anything in this case without a pedigree), it is not a priori immediately healthy because of that (most people don't see a vet because of bad owners, not because of their brilliant health!). <p/> Just because a dog is pedigree doesn't mean it will be healthy all its life. If the breeder is on the spot, i.e. cares about the dogs, he will do all possible tests to avoid doing the vets a disservice. So, if by means of tests (for which you only need to take blood or saliva - once in the life of the dog, because they keep these things and then you can order a new test every month and don't have to get rid of it all at once) you can breed in such a way that you don't get out affected dogs, I don't understand why not. (I partly understand all of you who have non-breeding approaches, because you don't want to admit mistakes (you turn a blind eye, you fool the ostrich...) i.e. you support stepparies and the torture of animals. (There are "specimens" among breeders too, but it also depends on what is a "specimen" for you.)) <p/> Pidog. I may have hit the antijack road with the mesan in terms of their health. It's just my opinion that they are one of the few dogs (percentage-wise) that are cared for like pedigree dogs of less common breeds (in short, tipitopi or as the law says - if there is something wrong with the dog, vet and not sus). <p/> Well, yes, the history of kcs is much more complicated, but so be it - some breed expert could give more precise information. The problem with the kcs is not so much that they have a short muzzle (nor is it extremely short like, say, a pug) but that the skull is too short in the temple. <p/>Now...the question was yes or no to the deliberate production of dogs. And it's not really a question of yes or no, but how. Because the question of breeding dogs is not so very simple that you can lump everything together. But to say that in general breeds are better/worse than mixes in any trait. Because breeds vary so much from one another, and there are often huge differences between types within a breed. You have a number of breeds whose typical representatives are distinctly vigorous, hardy and long-lived, and you have breeds that have more or less difficulty in this respect. In principle, any breed characterised by an exaggerated trait is more at risk. However, with clever planning and selection, even in these breeds you can get healthy dogs that function perfectly normally. <p/> Usually the biggest problems arise when a breed's trait is to be changed at short notice. Usually, unfortunately, because of a fad of one kind or another. A desire to "improve" rather than preserve the breed. What role does the standard play in this? A standard is nothing more than a description of a typical representative of the breed. The problem is that what is written can be interpreted in different ways. It says, for example, the ears are long - and then it starts to select for the longest possible ears. In the standard it says long hair, but they start selecting for dogs with hair that drags on the ground. Apart from the fact that no exaggeration is good in itself, you almost always get a surprise in the package when you go to select for one trait rather than the whole. Usually unpleasant. <p/> Having said the bull terrier - in that breed they have gone to changing the almost normal skull shape to a sheep skull. In a very short time. They have got so many problems in the package that the breed is in serious trouble and those who love the breed and would like to save it will have to think honestly about how to proceed, make a well thought out plan and probably take a big step backwards. The problem almost always arises when too much emphasis is placed on show results when selecting dogs for breeding and when selecting combinations. <p/> Mixes... whichever - but the fact is that even those "true" mixes that have had pedigree ancestors going back I don't know how many knees, or never at all, have all the hereditary problems that plague pedigrees. There are not even a few mixed breeds with various hereditary diseases, but until recently there have been a few who have even been diagnosed. <p/>A few years ago we had a lost blind mix, of the 'foxy' variety that has been around in villages here for ages, with no identifiable breed inside..... was diagnosed with two different hereditary eye diseases and a third that was the result of one of the two. In addition, he had chronic digestive and skin problems. But we also had a pretty healthy mix who couldn't hide the Yorkshire in his background, who lived to be just over 20 years old <p/> only he doesn't want a conformation, he wants a breed.... (or a chrysance between two problematic breeds) <p/> I also partly understand all of you who keep barking the same five half-truths endlessly, because you are just not able to comprehend those who think differently. <p/> After reading such and such threads, I realised that there are more and more people buying from breeders...I was sure that this would change over the years, but it has got worse...this forum has also become just a chatterbox, since some people have newly signed up and are just looking for a breeder to fill their free time.... <p/>If a different opinion is so unacceptable, you can ban me, of course. But in doing so you will confirm my point about not accepting dissent. <p/> Put it any way you like, no matter how badly a breed is doing, the non-breeding approximations of that breed are doing even worse.

__label__subjective Last Friday and Saturday, as part of the Parallel Relicross, we brought eight aggressive drifters to Loga's Blagomix racing park to sweat it out in a direct fight against each other, which this year is reserved for the superfinalists of the 2007 Auto Magazin Drift Cup. It was a lot of action! <p/> The sly smile of Dusan Lukic let me know that this was going to be drifting action. The task was even more interesting: to find drifters who would knife each other. Why not, we are always up for action! A look at the AM Drift Cup overall standings after 2 events gave us a skeleton of the contenders, which we supplemented with a couple of individuals of our choice. And we didn't regret it. Neither did the competitors. The cars that complained the most were the ones that Cimerman, Zvan & Co. got to know each other a couple of times. But there was no great (and inseparable) "love", because fortunately it was mostly platonics that prevailed;)). . At the competition itself, it was a completely different story. Almost professional and synchronised glides with few mistakes and an enthusiastic audience. After the end of the show, the cry echoed several times. "We hope to do it again, of course in the form of a competition in the Auto magazin Drift Cup calendar. Gladiators, get ready! <p/> P.S. Despite the fact that this was a magazine show, it is worth mentioning the winner. Congratulations. <p/> Comment: <p/> Poll

__label__subjective SUPER PRICE for a full facial rejuvenation treatment with targeted high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in the Tajna ljepote salon in Zagreb! <p/> Up to 10 years younger look and long-lasting results - more powerful than laser! Other HIFU treatments are also available in this offer - don't miss out on all of the additional offer options! Vouchers are redeemable until 8 January 2021! <p/> 158,60€ <p/> Buy voucher <p/> Great price <p/> Pay with Mastercard® or Maestro® and we'll give you back another 7,93€ on eWallet <p/> Would you like to look 10 years younger without surgery and the associated risks? The solution is HIFU (High Intensity Focused Ultrasound), a treatment that uses focused high-intensity ultrasound technology to heat tissue at a specific depth with extreme, surgical precision, resulting in a direct lifting effect. It is the world's first wrinkle smoother, and depending on the depth of the wrinkle, it is possible to lift the eyelids by 3-4 mm, reduce the pores on the face, firm and lift cheekbones, etc. However, in cases where the eyelid is drooping due to nerve damage or is congenital, the device cannot achieve the changes and surgery is required. Even very pronounced under-eye bags can be reduced, but they cannot be completely eliminated with one treatment. <p/> The excellent results of the HIFU treatment cannot be achieved with any other device or treatment, nor with radiofrequency, mesotherapy or dermapen. However, realistic expectations are necessary, because the kind of taut face you see on Hollywood celebrities is the result of expensive surgical procedures, without which such extreme results cannot be achieved. <p/> The HIFU treatment is performed by a trained beautician who also provides training on this treatment for beauty salons throughout Croatia. So far, she has "beautified" more than 150 women from Croatia and Slovenia, so you too can find out why it is worth visiting the Tajna ljepote salon for facial rejuvenation. <p/> This revolutionary and unique device can: completely remove forehead wrinkles, lift eyebrows by 3-4 mm (by lifting the upper eyelids), soften or completely remove wrinkles around the eyes, soften or completely remove under-eye bags, tighten enlarged pores, firm and lift cheekbones, soften or completely remove nasolabial folds and nasolabial folds between the nose and the lip, tighten the skin of the neck, tighten and remove the chin, tighten the skin of the décolletage. <p/> Ultrasound Rejuvenation Treatment High-intensity ultrasound generates large amounts of collagen. After the treatment, the skin is not damaged and does not require recovery. <p/> A single HIFU rejuvenation treatment is enough for great results!

But since I have the opportunity to popularize it a bit, especially among the younger generation, I would like to ask for some basic instructions to start with and then how the thing works in SLO. The game seems to me to be of above-average interest and interested parties would be extremely enthusiastic about it. However, as I am "new", I would ask for an "introduction". If anyone has time, I'd invite them for a drink lpm. <p/> Reply Written by soncek " Thu Oct 06, 2011 5:42 pm <p/> Popularization on POP TV: http://24ur.com/novice/it/sodobno-iskan ... ladov.html I'm a bit worried if any of the new forum members have surfed the net and I've been led astray by this post. <p/> A very simple FAQ would read something like this: At http://www.geocaching.com, type Slovenia in front of the magnifying glass and you get all the treasures that someone has entered in Slovenia. Or you can type in a place like Ljubljana and get Ljubljana treasures, etc... If you want to do more, like see what's going on with individual treasures or even enter your own adventures related to the treasure you're looking for, you have to register for free. If you do this, you will get the geographical coordinates of where the treasure is located and a hint of where exactly it should be. You can stand on it, but if the owner of the treasure doesn't give you a hint that it's buried under your feet, you'll be looking for it in vain. You can, however, pay approx. 20?per year, which gives you the right to hide the treasure, enter its coordinates in the portal and keep track of what happens to it, who discovers it, etc. If you find the treasure, you enter the date of its discovery in the treasure's notebook. You can take some things out and put in some of your new things, or at least as much as there was before. Each treasure contains a plastic waterproof box, a label with the location and address, a pencil, a pencil sharpener, and a notebook or notepad. You can also put anything in the box that is not food, not an animal or non-perishable. Crates can be "micro" e.g. a 2 or 3 cm plastic box, medium or very large. The crate can also contain a "tracer" or a plastic coin. You need to buy both official ones because the tracking numbers are stamped on the tracker and the coins are destructible and only made by certified producers. The tracker is inscribed separately and its job is to travel from treasure to treasure. You must not take it home for permanent safekeeping, but must put it in another treasure or leave it where it is. If you have moved it, you must be sure to write on the portal in which treasure you have placed it. Some people call this a "stopwatch". Vendors also offer official boxes, notebooks, pencils, stickers, etc. You don't need these if you don't want them. You can provide all this yourself. You can get free stickers here: http://www.techblazer.com/geocaching-log-sheets/ for micro for others: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=w ... mApU8vtHzw Make sure the sticker is dry! That's all. Instead of boring walks, you can search for treasures. You can use a garmin or other gps, I just use a phone with gps built in. It's worth installing Google Earth and you'll find your treasure even faster. If anyone has any other questions, just take them on the day. <p/> Reply Written by bucar " Sat May 05, 2012 12:13 am <p/> Commendable, but one has to be careful here: it's nice if a video post about a treasure is aligned with its owner, especially if the location of the box itself is also shown (spoiler). Many an owner would not be thrilled about that! Some time ago there was a pop-TV article http://24ur.com/novice/it/sodobno-iskan ... ladov.html and later on Spica there was another box right next to the real one and now there is quite a confusion because there are two treasures with a registration book. So public disclosure of the location of the treasures could bring problems... <p/> Reply Written by mrvidk " Sat May 05, 2012 6:20 pm <p/> @mmar: But you can pay about 20? a year and that gives you the right to hide the treasure, enter its coordinates on the portal and keep track of what happens to it, who discovers it, etc. that's not exactly true, because that only requires registration. <p/> Reply Written by FamilyMarussig " Fri May 10, 2013 10:50 pm <p/> As far as I know, it can't be hidden and located unless you pay a flat fee...? I caught that somewhere in the flood of texts.

__label__subjective That the Minister of the Environment and Spatial Planning, Andrej Vizjak, decided to deny our publication on Saturday morning via the twitter profile of the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning of the information circulating about his (possible) resignation due to the fiasco of the water referendum ... <p/> ... but not himself, personally, as Minister Vizjak, since his possible departure from the ministerial office is not a matter of a decision of the ministry, but of the Prime Minister and the SDS party, suggests at least two things: <p/> - The minister's (admittedly justified) nervousness ... <p/> - ... and the fact that the quiet behind-the-scenes battle (for) Minister Vizjak is far from over. <p/> Meanwhile, it is worth noting the following: within the SDS party, it is increasingly being realised that Vizjak is no longer the minister from the second Janša government and that Vizjak is now even being meaningfully defended by individual members of Odlazko's political media on the grounds that Vizjak is "Too Big to Fail", which is not unexpected either. It is a logical consequence of the fact that Odlazek's media was taken into ownership some time ago <p/> When the political scene smelled a bit of Tanja Fajon - as a possible prime minister (here), Sebastjan Selan, former director of the SOVA during Pahor's government, has already appeared, then director of Petan's flagship companies, the now-sold Marina Portorož and the not-yet-sold Terme Čatež, also allegedly involved in the secret filming of Minister Zdravko Počivalšek during the mask affair (source), when Selan himself made a quick buck selling protective medical equipment during the first wave of the epidemic of Covida-19. Selan has long been considered a silent and publicly unacknowledged advisor to Fajon and, according to our sources within the SD, has already started recruiting (read: promising posts and positions "when we come to power"), and in doing so, of course - quite expectedly for those who are more familiar with the situation in the party - he has bumped into the SD Secretary General Dejan Levanič and another behind-the-scenes SD recruiter, former SD Director General Uroš Jauševec. <p/> Today and tomorrow, including the days after Sunday's water referendum, are indeed thunder days for the Janez Janša government. After the referendum fiasco and the opposition's threats of a new constructive no-confidence motion, three extremely important votes of the National Assembly are scheduled today and tomorrow, when the government will need at least 45 and even 46 votes: <p/> - Today's vote on the demographic fund <p/> - And (tomorrow's) re-vote on the amendment to the law on infectious diseases, and the vote on the election of a new Minister for Digitalisation - Marko Boris Andrijanič (NSi). <p/> Because if all these votes fall, the Janša government will be seriously shaken, maybe even fall (well, the government representatives assure internally that they have the votes of the MPs guaranteed), which would most probably be followed by early elections. If these laws and Andrijanič do not fall, it almost 100% means that this government will last until the regular parliamentary elections next year... (Požareport) <p/> After the first articles about the separation of Eva Erjavec and Andrej Marčič (more at this link), sources close to Karel Erjavec say the following: this is something Erjavec will never forget about his son-in-law Andrej Marčič. We all know Erjavec, like most politicians, is terribly resentful, and he will get even. Besides, so our sources say, Marčič "was not exactly a sheep" during Eva Erjavec's pregnancy. So the confrontation between the Erjavec family and the businessman Marčič has really only just begun ... (Požareport)
__label__objective Former President Donald Trump addresses the Conservative Political Action Conference held at the Hyatt Regency on 28 February 2021 in Orlando, Florida. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) <p/>His comments were published on Friday on a new online platform he has set up to communicate with his followers. He also branded the 2020 presidential election "fake" while passing by both countries. <p/> Writing "From Donald J. Trump's desk", he said: "At 6:31 a.m. on 4 November, 149,772 votes came in in the state of Michigan. Biden received 96% of those votes and the state miraculously went to him. Has the Michigan State Senate already begun its review of the fraudulent 2020 presidential election, or will they begin soon? If not, they would be out of office. Also, at 3.42 a.m., the state of Wisconsin received a dump of 143 379 votes, also miraculously, given to Biden. Where did these 'votes' come from? They were both going to national elections, and that is on top of other corruption, without even including the fact that neither state has received the legislative approval required by the US Constitution. "<p/>Trump's comments came as the Justice Department expressed concerns about ballot security and potential voter intimidation stemming from a private Republican Senate recount in Arizona if the 2020 presidential election comes to Maricopa County. <p/>The Associated Press reported that in a letter to GOP Senate President Karen Fann, the head of the Justice Department's civil rights division said the Senate, which is from 2.1 million ballots from the state's most populous district to the contractor, could violate a federal law that requires ballots. to remain under the supervision of election officials for 22 months. <p/>And Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Pamela Karlan said the Senate contractor's plans to contact voters directly could constitute illegal voter intimidation. <p/>The Justice Department's letter came six days after voting rights groups urged federal officials to intervene or send observers to the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix at the State Fairgrounds, where ballots are counted. <p/> Trump used his new online platform after he was banned from Twitter, Facebook and other social networks following the attack on the Capitol building on 6 January. <p/> Twitter said Trump was permanently banned from tweeting after the platform said his tweets after the action appeared to support those who engaged in violence that day. <p/> Trump's new page does not currently allow people to comment on his posts.

__label__subjective Juan Martin del Potro defends his title in Estoril! <p/> ESTORIL, PORTUGAL - Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro won his second consecutive ATP 250 Series title on the sands of Portugal. <p/> The spectators in Estoril rightly came into their own. For the first time in the tournament's history, the top four seeds reached the semi-finals and the top two reached the final - and to top it off, the defending champion Juan Martin del Potro took home the trophy. <p/> In Sunday's final, the South American, one of the few players with a Grand Slam trophy, defeated Frenchman Richard Gasquet 6-4, 6-2 after 1 hour and 27 minutes of play. <p/> It was Delp's third final of the season and his second win. The 23-year-old from Tandil now has 11 laurels to his name and has played five more finals. <p/> Argentina's Del Potro won his second consecutive title in Estoril <p/> With six aces and a superb game on his serve, he denied Gasquet a title challenge. The Frenchman had no chance to get to a break point, but he gave away his opening shot three times and was threatened five more times. The quality difference in the final was too great, as can be seen by the points won (66:47). <p/> Del Potro won his fourth match against the 25-year-old from France, who is ranked 18th in the ATP rankings. Gasquet managed to beat the Argentine only once when they played for the first time, in 2007 in Indian Wells. That year, Richard Gasquet also played the Estoril final, but suffered a similar fate to today, only his opponent was Novak Djokovic.
__label__subjective What is it, apart from the understaffing and the overburdening, which is also or mainly administrative, that has broken the bottom of the primary health care barrel? <p/> The 2019 General Agreement exacerbates an unsustainable situation <p/> The 2019 General Agreement sets a new (increased) ceiling for registrations in family medicine outpatient clinics, which are already bursting at the seams with no systemic solutions. And this is very bad news indeed. <p/> The General Agreement, whereby the health 'partners' each year redefine the financial pie for the provision of health services and programmes, does not really have a partnership character, because the strength of the professional arguments is repeatedly undermined by the arguments of power, which in the end seem to have a single denominator: politics, which has nothing to do with health care. Controversial issues are always decided by the government. <p/> The Association of Health Care Institutions has proposed an annex to the General Agreement ... <p/> That is why the Association of Health Institutions of Slovenia has proposed the adoption of annex number one to the general agreement for this year. With regard to the overload in family medicine clinics in primary health care, where doctors in some health centres are announcing the termination of their employment contracts because there is no other solution on the horizon, this association has proposed a solution quite comparable to the conclusions recently adopted by the annual conference of the Fides doctors' and dentists' trade union. The proposed annex thus, rather surprisingly, puts doctors, their unions and the management of health care institutions on the same side. <p/> The proposal was made by the Association in accordance with the agreement on the suspension of strike activities signed by the Fides union and the government - and already in force in the general agreement for the 2017 and 2018 contract years. According to this agreement, primary care doctors can refuse to identify new insured persons once they reach the national average of the headache ratios for each specialty, while family medicine doctors and paediatricians can refuse to identify new insured persons once they reach a headache ratio of 1895. <p/> The Association of Health Care Institutions drafted the annex in accordance with the agreement on the temporary suspension of strike action. <p/> ... the ZZZS Board of Directors rejected the proposal <p/> Doctors may decide to take such a step if the employer has not exhausted all the human resources and organisational possibilities that would allow the definition of insured persons - tenders for new recruitments, proposal of the need for new specialisations, subcontracting of doctors, including retired ones, redirection of insured persons of full age from a paediatrician to a family doctor ... <p/> However, at yesterday's meeting, the ZZZS Board of Directors rejected the proposal to urgently include this option in the general agreement for this year. We are now in a situation in Slovenian healthcare where there is virtually no room for manoeuvre - for the time being in family medicine, but similar stories are unfolding in other branches of medicine too. And since this serious, complex problem is being pointed out not only by doctors or nurses and their unions, but now even by the management of health care institutions, this is a sign that the existing system is not, and can no longer be, a guarantee for the sustainable, high-quality, professional, comprehensive and safe operation of health care - a sign to which we urgently need to react and take immediate action to remedy the situation that has arisen. <p/> The proposal to urgently include this option in the general agreement for this year was rejected by the ZZZS Board. <p/> The association is convinced that the agreement between the government and the Fides trade union, enshrined in the agreement on the suspension of strike activities, should be respected - and that if the timetable for reaching the target norm had to be changed in this sense, the signatories to the agreement would have to resume negotiations and redraft the agreement. So what next - apart from the announced activities of primary care doctors? <p/> "We find it difficult to understand that the ZZZS Board is opposed to what has in fact already been agreed, signed and accepted" <p/> "We find it difficult to understand that the ZZZS Board is opposed to what has in fact already been agreed, signed and accepted" <p/> "We find it difficult to understand that the ZZZS Board is opposed to what has in fact already been agreed, signed and accepted. One is to continue with the annex procedure, but this kind of search for a solution is time-consuming and could drag on until the autumn. There is also another way. The new Minister for Health will have to deal with these problems as soon as he is appointed - and it is not impossible that the partners who are agreeing on the content of the general agreement will not be able to come up with a coherent, possibly even new, proposal to alleviate the acute situation we are witnessing at the moment. I can assure you that the association will be cooperative, because it wants to contribute to a reasonable solution - but if we find ourselves in a situation where emotions and other motives prevail, it will be difficult to find a solution," said Marjan Pintar, Director of the Association of Health Care Institutions, speaking to Health Portal. <p/> And what is your message to the new Minister of Health, Ales Šabedr? <p/> What do you expect from the new Health Minister Ales Šabedr? Write your suggestions and requests in the comments on our Facebook page. When we have enough, we will compile them in a book, which we will hand over to the Minister as a civil initiative for urgent action in the field of health.

__label__objective Every website needs hosting <p/> Creating a website absolutely needs hosting. This is the physical address where our website will live, so to speak. All of this takes place on the server where all the information that will be displayed on our website is located. This information can be in different sizes, shapes and formats - but it all adds up to the content of our site that we will show to the whole web. If you're new to web hosting, this article will introduce you to the most basic elements that are good to know. <p/> Table of Contents <p/> It all happens on the server <p/> First, let's take a look at what a server is. It's a powerful computer that has only one purpose - to host our website to which we connect via a domain. When buying web hosting we will have a few options to choose from. These options are: <p/> Server type <p/> Server capacity <p/> Server location <p/> Buying a domain <p/> If you are just starting out in business you may not be aware of all of the options listed above. We can get lost in all the different types of web hosting or server because we have never come across these concepts. It is important to realise that we need the right power and bandwidth of a hosting package to handle the traffic to our website. <p/> Different types of hosting <p/> Web hosting and servers come in many configurations. These configurations are made for different website profiles. The most common are: <p/> Shared hosting <p/> The most common way of running websites that do not need much power. In this case, the server hosts dozens or hundreds of different websites, all sharing the capacity of the server itself. This is most recommended for small webshops and projects where high power is not required. <p/> VPS hosting <p/> By far the most popular way of hosting websites. VPS hosting means that our website runs in a virtual environment. It is similar to shared hosting, except that we lease our own server capacity, but we don't share it with anyone. In addition, our files are completely secure because, although they are on the same system, they are physically separated from other users. <p/> Dedicated hosting <p/> Large companies and projects that have a lot of traffic need dedicated web hosting. Here, we lease an entire server for our use, putting all the power at our disposal. We don't share the server with anyone. <p/> Cloud hosting <p/> This is the newest type of web hosting, where multiple servers share the load of our website. This is recommended for the most demanding users who have huge daily website traffic.
