__label__subjective Fortune Telling - Tricks Revealed <p/> Man has always been curious about what the future holds. In the past - and still today for some primitive peoples - the future was foretold from the entrails of a sacrificed animal, but today we have a variety of divination techniques at our disposal: the horoscope, the crystal ball, palm or coffee grounds divination, numerology, charts, runes and the list goes on and on. Is it just a good trick or does fortune-telling really predict the future? <p/> " A sucker is born every minute " <p/> is a statement attributed to P. T. Barnum, an American entertainer and businessman who was famous for his pranks. The Barnum effect, on which fortune-telling is based, is named after him. It is the idea that a person recognises his own personality traits in common or stereotypical descriptions of personality. He even finds the descriptions incredibly true for him! <p/> Divination is often based on claims that cannot be verified or disputed, e.g. " You have great potential within you ."; " You have a need to be liked ."; describes characteristics that are typical of a certain age, gender or status e.g. a fortune teller tells an elderly woman that her hearing is probably deteriorating and she will need a hearing aid predicts events that will happen to each of us sooner or later e.g. " You will soon receive an interesting phone call .". The word "sometimes" is often used in predictions e.g. " Sometimes you say what you think clearly, but sometimes you bite your tongue to avoid resentment." <p/> Divination is more convincing when it involves personal information: name, date of birth, date of marriage, etc. It is also important that divination evokes a sense of magic or special energies, e.g. divination using magic crystals. For example, dressing in magical clothes or in a cloak that reflects negative energy adds a special impression of magic. <p/> The use of unusual or repetitive hand movements, steady strokes or sounds serves to bring the divination into a trance state where the individual is even more receptive to what is being said. <p/> When the prediction comes true <p/> The fortune teller has told us what is in store for us, and then we go out into the world with this knowledge. When we expect something to happen, even completely unrelated and coincidental events can be perceived as connected. For example, a fortune teller tells you: " You are going to have a car accident because of a flat tyre, you better not drive your car for a while. "Just in case, you really don't get behind the wheel. A week later, your friend tells you that the last time he had a flat tyre, he narrowly avoided a collision. " The guessing paid off! Good thing I wasn't driving! ", you utter, relieved that you have perceived two coincidental events as connected. <p/> Fortune-telling skills <p/> Good language skills are important for fortune-telling. A fortune teller speaks clearly, fluently and quickly enough that you cannot hear your own thoughts or reach out to him. At times he makes a claim and waits for your response. If you agree with the claim, he will reinforce it in the future. If you disagree, he will take the conversation in a different direction. Sometimes he will only make part of the claim and it is up to you to complete it as you see fit. <p/> A fortune teller must also be a good observer. He or she needs to recognise what you are communicating through your posture and facial expressions, what your clothes and fashion accessories say about you, your status and your lifestyle. Based on these insights, the fortune teller will be able to choose expressions that are even more suited to you. <p/> Fortune-telling is also helpful to the individual <p/> When fortune-telling predicts pleasant events and the successful achievement of goals, it can have a very motivating effect on the individual. He or she will embark on the journey to achieve his or her goals with confidence, working harder and better, as all his or her energy will be directed towards the goal. <p/> Divination can show a person a new way of looking at a problem and new solutions that they would not have thought of on their own. <p/> Is it possible to predict the future? <p/> So far, no divination has accurately predicted the future - so the claims could be scientifically verified. Perhaps in the future, as humanity comes to new knowledge, this will also be possible. But for now, keep your money in your wallet, your wallet in your pocket and your hand on your wallet, as the psychologist M. H. Birnbaum wrote.

__label__subjective Responsibility, in my view, should not only mean that they can (or even should) make decisions for the child, but above all that their decisions should be responsible, sensible and beneficial for the child's development. Also in the SSKJ, responsibility is defined (among other things) as a quality, a characteristic of that which, because of its importance, its consequences, requires great knowledge, care, and as an attitude in which someone has to give an explanation, a justification for their work, their actions Responsibility is therefore given to someone because it is assumed that they have the knowledge and the ability to do the "right" thing with the thing, the task, entrusted to them. The power that parents are given is not supposed to be given in itself, but because they know how to make better choices. Such responsibility is undoubtedly stressful for a parent. After all, most parents want the best for their children, but it is difficult for them to know what is really best for the child. So my mother wanted more dolls when she was a child and now she is stocking her daughter with dolls so that she does not feel frustrated. What may not be realised is that her daughter does not like dolls at all. <p/> The decision-making power that comes as a package with parental responsibility often grates on the nerves of various experts. Parents can decide whether to allow the school doctor to carry out a systematic check-up with the school doctor at all. Parents can decide whether or not their child can see the school counsellor (the exception, of course, is acute situations that need to be dealt with immediately - e.g. fights between children, extreme abuse of classmates or teachers, disruption of classes). Parents decide whether or not the doctor can treat their child. Parents decide whether or not the child can see a psychologist. All this power is great, of course, as long as parents really work with it in the child's best interests. But, unfortunately, this often does not seem to be the case. <p/> At school, for example, the child is highly socially anxious, unself-conscious, unaccepted by his classmates, and often finds it difficult to come to school. Teachers notice this problem and find it most useful to have the child see a school counsellor to develop social competences, to try to develop a better self-image. But the parents say no. Our child is not like that already. But at home he is normally talkative. The school has nothing to interfere in our family. <p/> Similar situation. At the age of three, the entire population of children in Slovenia undergoes a systematic psychological examination. This screening identifies both children who show mental disorders and children who are at high risk of developing neurotic disorders or maladjustment. Of course, not all children identified as being at risk will necessarily develop disorders. But the results of this screening have fairly good predictive validity. The prediction that the developmental trajectory of children identified as at-risk will be towards a neurotic structure is therefore true with a high probability. The psychologist therefore identifies a child as being at risk and suggests a form of follow-up treatment. If the parents do not want this treatment, it will not be given. And a child whose adverse developmental course could be reversed at the age of three may be a behaviourally problematic toddler at the age of ten, getting on the nerves of his parents and even more so of the school. Perhaps, of course, it is not necessarily nothing. But it is better to work preventively on a larger number of children than to have to take curative action when it is actually too late. And if someone has to finish his personality development later as an adult with a psychotherapist, this development will take somewhere around twice as long as it would have taken if it had been carried out normally in childhood. <p/> Parents thus have almost godlike powers over their children's development, and the various experts can only oppose them when the parents are very clearly endangering the child's health or life. The latter is difficult to prove, especially when the threat is not physical but psychological. And practically impossible when it comes to matters such as potentially risky personal development, which is ultimately only potential.

__label__objective Prostate cancer <p/> Prostate cancer or carcinoma of the prostate is a very common form of cancer and is the second most common cancer in men in Slovenia (source: Cancer Register of the Republic of Slovenia 2006). Pathohistologically, it is by far the most common form of adenocarcinoma. <p/> Symptoms and signs <p/> Prostate cancer has a long course without clinical signs and symptoms (up to 10 - 15 years). <p/> difficulty urinating: weak stream, difficulty starting to urinate, frequent urination <p/> difficulty getting an erection <p/> blood in the urine may also be present <p/> In advanced disease, when metastases are already present, bone pain may also occur. <p/> Diagnosis <p/> Treatment <p/> Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer. If the cancer is only locally present, the prostate is surgically removed (prostatectomy) and often the local lymph nodes are also removed. If the cancer is widespread, systemic treatment with hormone therapy is used. Surgical and hormonal treatment is often combined with radiation therapy.
__label__subjective What do the 500 most powerful supercomputers have in common? They are powered by Linux. <p/> The Top500, a website dedicated to keeping track of what's happening in supercomputing, has published its 53rd updated list of the world's most powerful computers. There are no changes to the top spots, with IBM's Summit and Sierra still at the top, followed by China's Sunway TaihuLight and Tianhe-2A, and Dell's Frontera in fifth place. Europe is represented in the top ten list with Switzerland's Piz Daint at number six and Germany's SuperMUC-NG, while France's Pangea III narrowly missed the top ten. <p/> All these supercomputers differ in terms of core count, floating point speed, power consumption and more, but they have one thing in common - they are all powered by Linux. <p/> Since Microsoft has taken away their right to use academic licences, the European Organization for Nuclear Research has decided to switch to open source solutions. <p/> For more than twenty years, CERN in Switzerland, or the European Organization for Nuclear Research as we call it, has been using Microsoft products under the licences that apply to academic institutions. These licences have to be renewed from time to time, and in March this year, when they wanted them again, Microsoft told them that such a licence was no longer valid for them and sent them the usual commercial contract, which more than doubled the price of the licences. CERN officials disagreed and revived the idea of switching to open source solutions. And the Microsoft Alternatives Project, or MAlt for short, was born. And what is the project all about? In their blog, they write that the aim of the project is to "regain control of our own data", and that it will start with the migration of mail services and Skype to open source alternatives, and if all goes to plan, all other services will follow. <p/> Microsoft must of course have reacted to the decision, because CERN is an extremely prestigious institution and therefore a nice reference. It offered a ten-year transition period during which the price of the licences would gradually increase, but the people in charge at CERN rejected the offer, saying that such costs were simply not sustainable. <p/> If the project is successful, the decision will certainly have wider implications. CERN is not the only institution of its kind to face what is known as vendor lock-in, or dependence on a single supplier. If they can show that essential services can be delivered without Microsoft and other providers of licensed software over which the user has no control, other similar institutions may decide to take a similar step.

__label__subjective Why did we lose the island? Because politics has defeated the judicial branch of government <p/> Since this year, the island of Bled has also been a symbol of the church's insatiability. It is a symbol of the complot between the church and a part of politics. It is a symbol of the weak authority of the Slovenian courts. This year, the island was finally donated to the church. But the church, as the court also found, got it illegally! <p/> How? Initially, two Slovenian courts, the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court, ruled that the island and its commercial real estate belonged to the state, while the church on the island was given to the parish of Bled. But the RCC wanted it all, so the first government of Janez JanÅ¡a came to its rescue, donating the island and its real estate to the church. The legal proceedings were restarted and came to a tragicomic conclusion. There were two proceedings in which the court should have annulled the gift contract. But the first one fell through because the first judge said that the state should have sued the Archdiocese of Ljubljana as well as the parish of Bled. And when the state sued both in the second, the second judge said that the state should sue only the parish. <p/> Since the "superminister" Å½iga Turk did not appeal the decision, the real estate on the island became the property of the church and the island became the property of the church. But illegally. The court wrote that "the evidence taken in the proceedings shows that there has been an impermissible traffic in real estate" and that the church should not have been allowed to take ownership of the properties, which were exempted from traffic under the Cultural Heritage Protection Act. "This prohibition is absolute, it is a coercive regulation" <p/> The Bled Island case shows very clearly how weak and God-fearing the Slovenian courts are, and how strong the church and the politicians beholden to it are at the same time.

It turns out that the printer only uses 3.8% of the red dye when printing our photo (which contains quite a lot of red). <p/> A test document to measure the cost of printing a photo. <p/> It is also interesting to note that the printer is a little more economical with dye than its predecessor, the i965, or rather the colour layers it loads are thinner. Therefore, the price of a photo print with the i990 is 74 tolars, while the same photo print with the i965 costs 84 tolars. <p/> Comparison of the consumption of the individual ink cartridges used to print our test photo. <p/> When we tested the printer, we complained that the photos produced were too pink. We have now repeated the test with the latest firmware and drivers (everything was still in the testing phase in March) and found that the results are much better, although still a little too pink. <p/> Taking the above and summarising what we have already written about this printer, the i990 is the best and fastest photo printer on the market today.

He captioned the photo "We are all monkeys.

It should be recalled that it was a player of the club, Miroljub Kostic, who was involved in a dispute with a black player of NK Maribor, Jean-Phillip Mendy, where the culprit for the quarrel was not found. However, the NHS has sent a strong message by the handshake and the videotaped statements of the two players that this type of behaviour has no place on or off football pitches. <p/> SPINS also joined the action as part of the FIFPro initiative of the World Association of Football Unions, which every year, as part of the FARE International Week of Action, raises awareness among athletes and the public to prevent unsporting gestures on sports pitches and in the stands with the "Show the Red Card to Violence and Discrimination" campaign. <p/> For the sixth time, Slovenian footballers have filled in an anonymous questionnaire on the situation prevailing at top-flight clubs, with which the SPINS union aims to highlight the strengths and weaknesses in the management of individual clubs. <p/> FIFPro is hosting a three-day meeting of the Guidelines Committee, the operations of UNI Global Sport Pro, the international organisation that brings together, unofficially for now, representatives of sports unions from around the world under its umbrella.

January at 7:15 pm at the ICSMC Office while an all-day meeting of anarchists is going on in the hall, who have asked me not to publish their photos because violent Nazis are searching for their faces on the web. <p/> The Carnian Outlaws are still retreating from the Cultural Pool after ten years of occupying this monument to the ruined social system of socialism. Behind the latter, Å ulc sheds no tears. In a decisive internal document, the municipality of Kranj, and the people with names and surnames in it, judged the Pool to be a building fit for demolition, and this made the job of Gross, the representative of the land-owners, much easier. For the last two years, the Municipality has been RENTING a building built by self-managed labour from a "generous" representative of the entitled descendants for a large sum of money. This temporary unhealthy state of affairs has ended, the four-day over-the-top festival "Dost mamo" with the subtitle "Izbruh's Last Pogo in the Swimming Pool" has been survived by Å ulc et al, and the property of the Izbruh Association is being moved to a warehouse, which, with luck, has been borrowed by a comrade. Gregor Kosi of the Bakery and I agree to convene the first meeting of the Pohorje Battalion in Kranj near Brdo and there let ourselves be irradiated by the facts and impressions of the freshly abandoned self-contained scene. In ten years of cultural struggles, at many hundreds of events, no one was killed and no one was wounded. Gregor and I are determined to drive the wedge that the Bakery Industry drove into the bottom of the Pool at the "Slovenian Cultural Pig" a few years ago. <p/> Franjo FranÄiÄ visited the MKSMC on Monday, bringing three books for our library that are being discarded by public libraries for lack of interest: the first is Dr. Franjo Derganec's memoir "The Bloody Rose", the second is Lad AmbroÅ¾iÄ Novljan's "March of the Fourteenth", and the third is "Radio Liberation Front" by JoÅ¾e JavorÅ¡ek. Franjo was happy to see a good direction by Katja Peganova for his text. He was returning from Trieste where the premiere took place. He was constantly talking and hitting the nail on the head, describing today's youth as the wormy foundation of the future. He is happy that his daughter listens to Edot Maajko and he went to buy her "Spomen ploÄo" for her birthday. <p/> On Monday, when I was "like a sick shit" (claims my wife Arijana) getting ready to report for four years of soft terrorism and to complete my report to the Youth Office, the top brass of the Likej Association came by, with TonÄi KuzmaniÄ, let's say, at the head. I was unpleasantly surprised because TonÄi does not see the unravelling or complication of the current issue of the municipality of Ankara as clear proof that the right and the left are united, because it is about the interests of Capital or the Port of Koper. It seems quite obvious to me that the parliamentary parties are in no hurry to comply with the will of a few thousand citizens, never mind the millions of euros that the Port of Koper brings in. TonÄi has been incomprehensibly reticent in his assessment of the matter. His first reaction was that he did not know enough about the matter. <p/> On Tuesday, I met with a lover of tidiness and efficient use of time and space, Simon Kardum, at the Kino Å iÅ¡ka. He was accompanied by his henchman ManÄek, who some time ago lectured me to be ashamed of myself for putting myself at the head of the Youth Field NGO Foundation at the age of sixty. There will be nothing of Brecljevanie in Å iÅ¡ka, but on 9 March this year, in the cathedral, which is by no means a public cultural trough, there will be a multimedia event "Feu Marko Brecelj" with a performance by a second-hand singer-songwriter, video projections and performances by DPZN. The subtitle of the event is "For the second time, for the first time at Kino Å iÅ¡ka". The first time I performed there with the Bulldozers was in 1975 at the Golden M. We did a performance called "Day of Disease" and we called it "Ashes and Leukaemia". <p/> On Wednesday, during the day, we sent out the Doganetta "Judgement in the name of the people", and in the evening, Franci BlaÅ¡koviÄ presented an excellent CD "Kobra je u brajdi" at the Kabina Gallery, and one with which he is not satisfied: "Ipak je lepiej travu puÅ¡iti nego Gori uÅ¡i sluÅ¡ati". On the night of Wednesday to Thursday I had no choice: I plunged myself into slow and mind-numbingly weak reporting for the aforementioned reputable institutions. I smoked French cigarettes exceptionally during this effort. The substantive report for the four-year soft terrorism programme may be of interest to some. It will be published at www.dodogovor.org. <p/> On Thursday morning the MKSMC came to do electrical measurements and came across a sleepless man from Klanec. I immediately called their boss and "dropped" Supervisor Vid and Supervisor Samuel on him at ten o'clock. These two young members of ours described and listed in detail the oversights and negligence of his unforgettable contractors, headed by the palm buyer Danjel. That afternoon Dr Vlasta JaluÅ¡iÄ gave a lecture on "History, Politics, Law / Rights: Hegel" in the MKSMC hall but unfortunately I was unable to attend due to the unavoidable financial part of the report to the Youth Office. It was super fine, I was half out of my mind. And at the end, cinema! Vid spun us the US-Argentine 35 millimeter too crime flick "Our Father" ("Padre nuestro"). <p/> On Friday, when I was quite euphoric from nine hours of sleep, Arijana started to sweat and immediately gave me a dramatic ultimatum. The nine formerly thick white envelopes with slips of paper, receipts, lists and now and then even notes, which had been (briefly) waiting in the top left inside pocket of my jacket for eight months to three weeks to be counted and sorted out by me, had to go immediately on the table and into the sunlight and under the magnifying glass. Some of the receipts for the June Friendship Offensive were barely legible with a magnifying glass and a good deal of imagination, and one no longer had a speck of colour on it. At the time of writing, the contents of all the envelopes have been examined three times, the worn envelopes have been replaced with new ones, and things have been tidied up and sorted out in my pocket and in my head. The anarchists left two hours ago, the kitchen is left in order, Teja and Luka have cleaned the floor! Cha, cha, cha, cha. <p/> Vid has just embedded an audio recording of Friday's meeting with the initiative groups organising the concerts on the Dodogovor website archive (Sunday, 30 January 2011 at 23:20). It's not short and it's mostly me speaking. I had so much to say about our twenty years of fighting against the wind and the reasons for the decision to freeze the DPZN co-organisation in February and March. You are welcome to listen! It is better for you if you give it up. Only then don't bring out the insulting, yellow details of my truthful and righteous sub-pedagogical fabrications. We're already at six thousand seven hundred characters, the situation is alarming, my sturdy editor Boris Vasev is looking at his watch, and there's just this: on Saturday twenty of us watched a good Jarmusch's "Coffee and Cigarettes", Vid was baking popcorn, and Tomi suggested a hip hop concert by the uncontrolled in the last days of February. Who are the Uncontrolled? They are Slovenian citizens without controlled origins: mainly Bosnians, blacks, American women under Triglav. I have long been urging them to come to MKSMC to prepare something, which of course Breclj with his negative karma could not manage! But 23 year old semi-controlled Tommy, the president of the "KAM" association, managed to do it. When we are allowed to vote in Koper, he will stand as an independent candidate. Vote for him! Chao, bao!

__label__subjective Real estates in Styria Renovated two-bedroom apartment in ZreÄe for sale <p/> REAL ESTATE FOR SALE <p/> This pleasant and recently renovated two-bedroom apartment in ZreÄe is a great opportunity for a family who wants to live in harmony with nature, but at the same time have all the infrastructure of a small town at their fingertips. ZreÄe is also a paradise if you appreciate the healing power of thermal water. <p/> Do you enjoy furnishing and decorating your home? Great. The apartment is sold unfurnished. <p/> Everything you will see in the photos below was... <p/> ... just an idea. <p/> I'm sure you have lots of ideas about how to decorate your new apartment. And I'm sure you'll have a few more as you look at the pictures. <p/> When the current owner bought the flat, it was not in the best condition. It was in need of a complete renovation. Two years ago, with creative ideas, a willingness to work and a lot of money, it was transformed from an ugly duckling into a beautiful swan.... <p/> A view into the colourful and bright living room. <p/> The 17 square metre living kitchen is spacious and bright (you spend all day in it, by the way). It faces west and has access to the balcony, which is nice and useful at the same time -- you can ventilate the kitchen very quickly. <p/> Having your first coffee in the morning on the balcony, overlooking nature waking up, is an invigorating experience. <p/> From the kitchen, a door leads to the living room, where you can create another spacious bedroom. <p/> From the central corridor there is an entrance to the east-facing bedroom. <p/> You will certainly enjoy the separate toilet and bathroom. <p/> The apartment has had all the plumbing replaced, the walls patched and repointed, laminate flooring laid and brand new fittings fitted. The apartment has been given a new makeover, while retaining its functional layout. The owner would love to move it to the Ljubljana area, where she is moving to, but unfortunately this is not possible. <p/> The two-bedroom apartment is therefore waiting for a new owner who will breathe his own ideas and plans into it and furnish it as he wishes. <p/> If you want to be happy for life,... <p/> ... have a garden, says the Chinese proverb. If the old Eastern sages are right, then you can't go wrong with this apartment. From your balcony, you can admire a garden that can be used for growing garden flowers as well as home-grown vegetables. The gardens also have a tap for watering on hot summer days. <p/> In the basement, you also have a spacious (just over 7 square metres) cellar where you can store everything that won't go into the apartment. <p/> A great base for sports and recreation... <p/> ZreÄe, a small town in the Savinja Valley, is ideal for those who love nature but want to have all the city's infrastructure at their fingertips (and toes). Just a five-minute walk from your apartment, you'll find a shop, post office, pharmacy, kindergarten and the ZreÄe Primary School. If you turn on your heel in the opposite direction, you can quickly breathe the fresh air in the nearby forests or relax your mind while walking in the nearby hills. <p/> ... and a paradise for relaxation in the thermal pools of the ZreÄe thermal spas <p/> The first association with ZreÄe is tourism, as it is a thermal centre and nearby Rogla is a ski resort with a long tradition. <p/> The ZreÄe Spa offers a rich wellness programme, including saunas, a fitness centre, a gym and various health therapies. You're sure to enjoy an afternoon swim in one of the spa's eight swimming pools, or perhaps pamper yourself with a Thai massage. <p/> Rogla is the place to be for all those who love the snowy slopes - skiers, tobogganers and boarders, for whom a special slope has been prepared. With its sports stadium for fitness training, Rogla is also well known to local and foreign athletes. <p/> When ideas come to life... <p/> Every beginning is difficult, but when we look back on it after a while, we realise that those were actually the best times. What started out as dreams, ideas and plans evolve, take shape and finally become reality. <p/> Perhaps this apartment is a beautiful opportunity to live a new life. When you see it, you'll know. Call 01 421 22 22 or 051 666 444 and talk to Stank Å tupica.

Avocado oil is an excellent source of antioxidants, essential fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins A, D and E and minerals. But have you ever thought of using this delicious fruit to soothe and heal your skin? <p/> AVOCADO OIL: USES AND BENEFITS <p/> Absorbent oil has many benefits for your skin, you can apply it directly to your skin or mix it with your favourite beauty products. The antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents in avocado oil help your skin stay smooth, strong and elastic. <p/> Vitamins A, C and E are the source of your health and well-being <p/> Oxidation is part of life, in fact it allows us to harness energy from food. The body uses free radicals to detoxify, and defend itself against harmful micro-organisms. However, problems arise when prolonged exposure to oxidising factors leads to an excessive amount of oxidative stress and a consequent decline in the body's defences. So remember that vitamins A, C and E are very important, along with other vitamins. <p/> The main nutrients that protect are: vitamins A, D, C, E, selenium, carotenes, coenzyme Q10, alpha-lipoic acid, glutathione and other phytonutrients in foods, spices and herbs.

__label__subjective How is sex marketed? <p/> Adjectives that traditionally market sex well are spiritual, spiritual, esoteric and especially tantric <p/> In the early 1990s, massage parlours sprouted up all over our young homeland, where "professionally trained" masseuses kneaded the bodies of men, most of them bed-ridden and stressed, eager for invigorating exotic massages: Thai, Chinese and Malay, ordinary and specialised, hand and foot. Was it really in the perfumed, dimly lit rooms that the oldest craft was practiced? The lion's share of the clientele would answer this question with a hand on the Bible, in the words of former US President Bill Clinton: "We did not have sex with those women. "The hired girls did, in fact, massage the clients to the best of their unprofessional abilities, and if a part of the client became unexpectedly stiff, they would simply do what was in the job description manually to relieve the client's tension. And that was it. Massage parlours did not, in principle, engage in conventional sexual intercourse, but that does not mean, of course, that what the lay public understands by the technical terms of blow jobs, hand jobs, spankings and whisperings did not take place there. In short, the owners of Slovenian massage parlours behaved in accordance with the political correctness of Western Christian civilisation, which tolerates many things, but not calling it fucking. Or it tolerates the presence of sex in its midst only if you put it in an artistic, installation, authorial, artisanal, institutional, aesthetic, cosmetic or spiritual context. Sex as such is not desirable. Hence the circus around pornography, prostitution and similar phenomena, which are not really about anything in terms of substance. <p/>The adjectives that traditionally market sex well, together with its side-effects, consequences and problems, are spiritual, spiritual, esoteric and, in particular, tantric. Tantric sex is a hit. It has infiltrated the terminology of the psychiatric profession, it has taken over the tabloid media, it has possessed dissatisfied housewives who dream of nirvanic continuity and dissatisfied gentlemen who muse at the thought of eight-, twelve- or twenty-four-hour erections, even though they have no idea what they could achieve with their stream limbs in that time. One thinks of His Holiness Guru Bhagwan Sri Rajneesh, whose revolutionary approach to tantric themes forced him to leave his spiritualised mother India in 1981 and settle in Oregon, USA, with a vast fleet of custom-built Rolls Royces. His Holiness set up a Tantric commune in the middle of Oregon, which traded heavily in enlightenment, and became famous for not granting quantity discounts to even the most wholesale buyers. When names from the music and film show business lined up, many paid obscene sums just to stand in line. And it was only a matter of time before the epicentre of practical Tantric philosophy would move to sunny California, where believer-friendly religions were springing up on a daily basis, and then, like all American fads, it would come pounding down on the old continent and, by extension, Slovenia.

__label__subjective The debate often brings to the surface first those values that people in the kindergarten, school, organisation think they "should" have or "should value" in order to be respected as much as possible by themselves and the organisation. <p/> We know that the values people express publicly can be very different from the values they express in their own actions and behaviour. People's behaviour often seems to 'violate' values that they claim to hold important and sacred. Such "double morality" is a commonplace phenomenon, reflecting the disconnect between one's actual values, what one really values and cares about, and how one would like others to see one. <p/> If this phenomenon is so typical of human beings, it is logical that it cannot be avoided when discussing values within an organisation. Such a discussion often brings to the surface, in particular, the values that people feel they "should" have or "should value" in order to make themselves and the organisation as attractive and respected as possible. <p/> If the values that are written down do not match those that the organisation and its people express in their actions and behaviour, they cannot have a positive impact on employees and users. <p/> Just as the "double morality" of the individual is unattractive, the "double morality" of the organisation, or the wide gap between its stated values and what its actions express, is an ideal breeding ground for cynicism, sarcasm, ridicule and other negative phenomena. Written values that are literally at odds with what happens in the organisation cannot possibly have a positive impact on its employees and users. On the contrary, they often become a source of further dissatisfaction. It is therefore all the more important that the debate on the values of the organisation really goes deep, not contenting itself with superficial answers, and that it examines and tests the values it evokes. <p/> For example, if the debate points out that what matters most to employees is "good relations with users", it is important to ask whether this is really being implemented in practice. Does the day-to-day behaviour of the organisation and its people really reflect this concern? Do their actions and procedures really reflect this? <p/> In summary, it is useful to talk about, discuss, clarify and define values. But in doing so, organisations should be as careful as possible to avoid the tendency to "sugarcoat" the truth, to portray values "as they should be" rather than "as they are". Otherwise, the debate on values can quickly turn into its opposite, which instead of having positive consequences, encourages cynicism, sarcasm and dissatisfaction, and has a negative impact on employees' motivation, work zeal and morale.
__label__subjective For many, this has rolled away the FB stone <p/> Many who use Facebook for business have found themselves in a dead end called Facebook Private Profile. This is because it is for private communication, but for commercial purposes it is forbidden. And users often notice this too late, usually when they can no longer add new friends. The maximum number of friends on a private profile is 5,000. <p/> And the fun is over! We can no longer add new users, we risk being reported by competitors for using Facebook incorrectly and we risk losing the friends we have. Usually they then set up a new FB page, but when you have to start from scratch and migrate friends to the page, it's not an easy job. Everyone is a friend rather than a fan ;)
__label__objective The Rectors' Conference of the four Slovenian public universities met in Maribor at the weekend for its first meeting since the University of Maribor took over the two-year presidency of the informal association. According to the Rector of the University of Maribor, Zdravko KaÄiÄ, the meeting focused, among other things, on the establishment of the e-Nakvis information system. <p/> Regarding the implementation of the system, which is experiencing some technical problems, KaÄiÄ said that they expect its quality implementation and smooth operation within six months, in line with a positive user experience. <p/> In addition to KaÄiÄ, the rectors - Igor PapiÄ from the University of Ljubljana, Klavdija Kutnar from the University of Primorska and Danilo Zavrtanik from the University of Nova Gorica and his colleagues - also discussed the importance of the functioning of key support activities of universities related to the implementation of integrated career orientation for students, graduates and other target groups. <p/>The competent Ministry of Education, Science and Sport was called upon to ensure continued and continuous funding for the operation of university career centres and centres set up to support teaching, as these activities are a necessary part of regular higher education activities. According to Mr KaÄiÄ, these are funded on a project basis and are due to expire this year, so it would be advisable to start with permanent funding. <p/> There was also a discussion on legislation concerning universities, in particular the harmonisation of the law on research and development and the amendment to the law on higher education. The fall of the government was not the best thing for them, as they were on the verge of getting the draft laws through the parliamentary procedure. KaÄiÄ therefore hopes that they will not have to start all over again with the arrival of a new government. <p/> PapiÄ also regrets that they are back at the point of two years ago, when the legislation was also practically in place, but after the elections the whole thing fell into the water. With a new minister, they have reached a point where a working group has already handed over a draft law on research to the ministry, but now the resignation of the government is putting the whole thing in doubt again. <p/> The rectors of the two Seaside universities are of a similar opinion. Kutnarjeva would like whoever takes office in the new government to accept the bulk of the law already drafted by the profession and send it for further consideration as soon as possible, while Zavrtanik regrets that they behaved somewhat neuralgically at the end of its coordination, since otherwise, with some pragmatic solutions, the law could perhaps have been in parliamentary procedure today. <p/> The Rectors also took note of a promotional video entitled Slovenia. Green. Creative. Smart, and they also addressed an initiative to the public agency Spirit to include in such films promoting the country in the future a presentation of its development potential, represented by the scientific and research work of universities and institutes.
__label__subjective While enjoying a stroll through the colourful streets of Burano at the end of April, I was interrupted by a telephone call from Stojan asking 'Hi, Momak. Would you like to go to Mont Blanc? " Although it was already warm in summer, I froze for a moment. My answer was yes. An old holiday must be made the most of. If it is an active one, so much the better. <p/> After all the coordination, Polona, Stojan and I are finally part of a mini-team that monitors the weather forecast over Shamonix and gathers information on a daily basis. On Monday, we make a quick decision to leave on the morning of Tuesday 13 May... from rainy Ljubljana. We set off for Italy, past Venice, Milan, towards Aosta and through the tunnel under Mont Blanc to Chamonix. On the way, we have a coffee on the Italian autostrada with Klemen, who is going to the same places on business as a mountain guide. <p/> In the evening we arrive in a still cloudy town under snow-capped peaks. You can't see the peaks, but you can feel the cold of the glaciers. <p/> In the evening we are in the same hostel as Klemen GriÄar and TomaÅ¾ JakofÄiÄ, "gasterbajters" with a lot of experience up there. They give us selfless advice and answer all our questions. <p/> Our original plan was to take the gondola on Wednesday to the Aiguille di midi, 3842 metres high, from where we would ski down the Vallee Blanche and do a tour to the Torino hut, where we would spend the night. On Thursday, the plan was to ski down the Valee Blanche to Montevers and then take the cog railway back to Chamonix. <p/> On Friday we planned to ride again to the Aiguille di midi mid station, and from there climb up to the Gran Mulets hut, and on Saturday night start for the summit. The weather forecast for Saturday was also promising. <p/> Polona, at the suggestion of Klemena, checked the reservation at the Gran Mulets hut and was informed that we had a reservation from Thursday to Friday. Apparently the dec up there had written the date wrong when the first booking was made. <p/> The combination of days, times, reservations starts. In the end, we come to the conclusion that we will climb up to the Torino hut on Wednesday, descend into the valley on Thursday and immediately climb back up and to the Gran Mulet hut. Well, the plan is one thing, the reality is another. <p/> When we arrive at the Aiguille di Midi lookout, we do not even get a panoramic view, let alone the conditions for skiing on glaciers covered with 30 cm of fresh snow. Fog and clouds obscure the peaks and descend to the valley. This time the weathermen have kicked the darkness. <p/> This is this from the acclimatisation tour. Unfortunately, we descended to the valley by gondola. <p/> On Thursday we finally wake up to a clear morning. <p/> We take the gondola up to 2,310 m, to the Plan de l'Aiguille, and from there ski under the north face of the Aiguille de midi towards the Gran Mulets hut. <p/> Soon, the full majesty of the mountains and glaciers is revealed. <p/> The sun is already warming up strongly, but the ice sculptures are still mighty. <p/> Before crossing the Bosson at the Jonction section, we take narrow bridges over glacial crevasses to reach the flank below the Gran Mulets hut, which stands on top of a rocky ridge. <p/> From here, the Aiguille di midi is visible from the other side, with Chamonix below. <p/> On the other side of the flank, icebergs glisten in the sun. <p/> At the bottom of the hut, we take off our skis and follow the carved path up to the hut, chain and rope in tow. <p/> In the hut, we settle into our shared beds and wait for dinner. While we wait, I do a few laps around the house... <p/> Next to the hut is a building which, if it had water in it, could be called a toilet. So it can only be called a "shithole" with a capital R, as the "septic tank" is down there on a glacier somewhere. <p/> Prayer flags colour the day. <p/> The sun slowly goes to rest, and up here the real show of light and colour begins. First, the snow expanses take on a whole new hue with soft shadows... <p/> The wind doesn't let up up there. <p/> A ball of fire will slowly hide under the clouds. <p/> The permafrost under the hut ensures a constant climate. <p/> And it's... day. My 44th , ... birthday. It was beautiful. <p/> When the sun hadn't even set, we were all in bed ... by 3am. Then up, breakfast, a night descent along the chain and rope to the snow below the hut and a start in the glare of headlamps to the summit. <p/> We walk in the dark on the groomed spur for a good while before the day begins to wake up. The lights are still burning in the town ... <p/> It starts with blue light up here ... <p/> Slowly the outlines of the hills turn into colourful pictures. <p/> The glaciers remain cold despite the first warm rays of the sun ... <p/> ... and the crevasses beneath the DÃ´me du GoÃ»ter are menacing. <p/> And when you look around, everything is still so beautiful that it couldn't be more beautiful. <p/> The valley is slowly waking up while it's coldest up here. <p/> You talk to the clouds and the nettles and ask them to let the sun go ... <p/> And the top is so close ... and far away at the same time. <p/> The last metres below the Vallot bivouac are pretty blown. The skis go on the ruzak, and instead of skis, I mount the crampons on my feet. The breath was getting deeper here, but there was no real strength in my legs. After a good five hours of walking we reach the bivouac. <Polona and Stojan are already at the bivouac when I get there. Looking down ... <p/> ... towards Mont Maudit ... <p/> ... and towards the one we came for. <p/> Ahead of us, there are already a few convoys going at a slow pace towards the summit. <p/> There is some hesitation about whether to go with or without skis towards the summit. In the end, we decide to go without. Meanwhile, Klemen continues past the bivouac with his team. <p/> We follow a little way behind him. After a few hundred metres, I realise that my lungs are straining almost to empty and my muscles simply don't have enough energy anymore. The pace is getting slower and slower, and at this rate we would have blown our timetable for the descent. There is no alternative but to turn around. I give Stojan and Polona a clear path to the top, but they decide to descend. <p/> Meanwhile, the wind picks up a bit up there. <p/> We continue to enjoy the views as we prepare for the descent. <p/> The summit will wait ... until next time. Meanwhile, one team is already skiing down the north side of the mountain. <p/> Another hello to the summit, and then the descent. <p/> For the first few pitches the snow is hard, blown, icy in places, and so are the muscles. I stop several times, trying to enjoy at least the views <p/> Below the bivouac, the skiing is better. The only distraction from carefree powder is the thought that we are near and on a glacier, and that there are glacial crevasses hiding under the snow. The fact that the previous day a mountaineer fell into a crevasse fifteen metres deep also gives us food for thought. He was lucky in the accident, as he was pulled to safety unharmed by helicopter rescuers. <p/> During our stops, we admire the snow and ice masses, so innocently white, yet menacing and dangerous. <p/> We ski towards the approach. The snow becomes a little crusty in places, a little heavier lower down, but still skiable. <p/> Soon we are above the Grand Mulets hut. <p/> We cross the Bossons over the Jonction, strung up. We are not the only ones. Somehow we are skiing at the same time with two Spaniards and a group of Austrians. <p/> The sun is already quite strong down here and it is not very pleasant to wait in line to cross the glacier. We are quickly across, then under the northern walls of the Aguilla di Midi we continue our way to the middle station of the gondola. <p/> The crossing is rather protracted, more so than the other way round, as we have some work to do. Finally, the greenery of the valley and the gondola come into view. <p/> We arrive in Chamonix in the afternoon, beautifully tired, hungry and thirsty. Maybe even a little disappointed. But, all the same, we have reached an altitude of 4362 m, skied down from there and arrived in the valley alive and well. For one of this year's final tours, that will be a big enough success <p/> P.S. Apparently, the summit is still where it was before we wanted to climb it ourselves. And I think it will be there for a while... waiting... maybe for us too <p/> One more thing about the costs: after the tour, we took a free afternoon in Chamonix, spent the night, and then headed home the next morning. <p/> For the trip from Tuesday to Saturday, for tolls, tunnel fees, fuel, accommodation and gondola tickets, we each spent just over 300.
__label__objective The efficient use of condensing heat is influenced by a number of factors, the main ones being the hydraulic integration of the condensing boiler into the heating system and the temperature of the return water from the heating system. <p/> In low energy houses (NEH) and passive houses (PH), the heating and domestic hot water (DHW) systems are upgraded with solar systems. When designing solar systems, it is important to bear in mind that modern individual components are not a guarantee of good system performance. It is more important that the components are coordinated with each other and optimally integrated into the domestic heating and hot water system. <p/> Today, most houses have a habitable attic, and there is also intensive construction of attic dwellings. However, many loft dwellers dread the summer. It is unbearably hot in their apartments on summer nights. When building a new or adapted attic, you should also ask about the properties of insulation and other materials. This will save not only sleepless nights, but also later expenditure on ventilation and air-conditioning systems, which are not needed if the roof is properly and sufficiently insulated. <p/> The eco-material label is used to describe a product that is characterised by its ability to minimise the impact on the environment throughout its life cycle. In the case of thermal insulation materials, from the point of view of the user, a division between traditional materials and ecological or alternative materials has become established in practice. This division can be partly disputed, since when choosing any insulation material, one must take into account its good qualities, while at the same time taking into account its disadvantages. <p/> Photovoltaic modules, made up of cells connected in series, convert solar energy directly into direct current. The sun's rays fall on the surface of the solar cells and the sun's radiant primary energy is converted into electricity. The transformation is direct, with no intermediate transformation into thermal and mechanical energy. The incident light on the crystal lattice of the selected substance releases an electric charge. In radiation, light quanta - photons - strike the faceplate of the semiconductor and are absorbed. This releases electron pairs, which remain separated due to the internal electric field and thus generate an electric voltage. <p/> The use of geothermal energy (heat from the earth) as a source of energy which, in terms of the quantity of resources, meets the criterion of sustainability, does not increase global radiation due to CO2 emissions when harnessed, and can therefore be considered as a renewable source of energy.
__label__objective Annual General Meeting, 19 March 2013 <p/> Traditionally, and in accordance with the law and the provisions of the Statutes of our Association, the General Meeting, as the highest body, adopted the report on the activities, the financial report and the report of the Supervisory Committee for the year 2012. This was the first year of the new term of office of the bodies of the Association and the 22nd year since the founding of the Association. <p/> Of course, we remained true to our mission. Raising awareness among the membership and the general population about the importance of cardiovascular disease prevention has been, is and will continue to be a constant feature of our work. <p/> The reports were adopted unanimously by the branch representatives present. <p/> In short, we can report that we have achieved most of the tasks we set ourselves in our work programme. <p/> We would like to take this opportunity to highlight some of the innovations that have marked the Slovenian prevention scene, in particular the measurement of the ankle-brachial index, the atrial fibrillation prevention programme, for which we have been awarded a global prize since the end of 2011, and the establishment of the 25 Ã 25 network of NGOs in the field of public health. All three of these innovations have been widely covered by the Slovenian media. We carried out all the well-known preventive measurements and added venous plethysmography, helped several thousand people with various advice, and organised many interesting lectures and workshops. <p/> The magazine For the Heart has been our hallmark for the past year. We are proud of all 7 issues and also at the AGM we thanked the editorial board headed by Prof. Dr. Ales Blinec, MD. <p/> We organised many hikes, excursions and other forms of recreation. If we were to add up all the kilometres walked by our hikers and walkers, we would come up with a big number. <p/> The World Heart Day events started with a march in Novo mesto and continued with events in various places around Slovenia, with the main event taking place at the BTC in Ljubljana. <p/> It is also worth remembering Melodies for the Heart. The Slovenian Octet in the Ljubljana Opera House really proved how a beautiful song has a soothing effect on the heart. <p/> Our branches and the Society as a whole are organising many activities. It is simply not possible to present everything in a short article. <p/> The sources of funds have also changed quite a lot. The share of income from our own activities and the share of funds obtained through calls for tenders have increased, while the share of funds from advertising has decreased. <p/> All in all, 2012 was a successful year for our association, although we made a loss of EUR 2 200, which we will cover from the association's fund. At the same time, the General Assembly clearly recognised that we need to look for new and ever new programmes. Only in this way will the Society be able to successfully fulfil its mission in the future. <p/> At the end of the Assembly, the President of the Heart Association, Matija Cevc, MD, and the Vice-President, Boris Cibic, MD, presented the 2012 awards of the Society. Silvo Gorenc, MD, Tomislav MajiÄ, MD, and Viljem Å Äuka, MD, became Honorary Members. Congratulations and thank you for your work.
__label__subjective FRIENDLY FRIENDSHIP THROUGH EXCHANGE OF USED CLOTHES, TOYS AND BOOKS <p/> A network to promote quality of life and relationships in Posavje, involving the EMMA Institute, the Friends of Youth Association KrÅ¡ko, the Marriage and Family Institute Novo mesto and KrÅ¡ko, The Regional Union of Pensioners' Associations of Posavje - PZDU Posavje, Ozara BreÅ¾ice, the Association of Ecological Movements of Slovenia - ZEG, the Posavje Regional Contact Point for NGOs - PRSTaN and the Red Cross Sevnica, took place on Thursday, 19.A tea party with a special meaning: a pleasant get-together with an exchange of second-hand clothes, books and toys. <p/> The purpose of the meeting, which was to socialise, make new acquaintances, overcome alienation and become eco-conscious, was achieved, as a large number of people exchanged throughout the afternoon, who positively evaluated such a gathering and welcomed it with the hope of the continuation of such events. Natural resources were saved for 200 reused products. We are aware of the importance of linking and combining the strengths of different organisations, both social and ecological, in a common effort for a non-violent society. EMMA will continue to work with similar ideas and incentives, as this tea party was a good start and will serve as proof that many small pieces can make a big success.
__label__subjective Objectivity in the age of gifts <p/> We all like to receive gifts, and many of us like to give them too. It is only right that a gift should reflect a sincere desire to show appreciation and affection to our neighbour. It is nice if the gift surprises and inspires us with a sense of playfulness, mystery, joy and gratitude. Unfortunately, gift-giving too often degenerates into an alienated, routine and disembodied following of customs. Some gift-givers even see gifts as something that belongs to them, which, when expectations are too high, can lead to ingratitude, disappointment and, eventually, resentment. <p/> A good year ago, the legislator gave us a gift. It made part of the performance-related salary tax-free. But it did so in such a veiled and disguised way that we sometimes wonder whether it was sincere in its intention, because the tax gift announced with fanfare has two flaws that the uninitiated tend to overlook. This is because the payment is not exempt from all taxes, since only income tax is reduced and social contributions are not. And such contributions are not exactly a negligible burden in our country. Moreover, the tax-advantaged payout is not for everyone, but only for those who are successful in business. Business performance is usually determined on the basis of balance sheet data, but this is only finally known in the first quarter of the new financial year. <p/> On the basis of such a muddled solution, some Pharisees can now provoke and blackmail, while the ignorant and deluded demand and resist. A collective performance award is not a gift at the end of the calendar year and must be distinguished from Christmas presents or be properly justified and linked to past performance. <p/> It is right to welcome any gift, including tax gifts. Perhaps the somewhat convoluted tax solution has even awakened in us a forgotten sense of mysterious anticipation. <p/> On behalf of the IKS editorial team, I wish you a peaceful and happy Christmas and a happy and prosperous New Year.

__label__subjective Berdych defeats defending champion in Stockholm final <p/> 19.10.2014 <p/> STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN - Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic triumphed at the ATP250 tournament in the Swedish capital. He had to beat defending champion Grigor Dimitrov to win the title, but with new points for the ATP Race Rankings, he kept his chances for the final Masters alive. <p/> Tomas Berdych reached the final of the If Stockholm Open for the second time. In the final, he defeated Grigor Dimitrov, who won here last year, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4. <Berdych, 29, does not yet have a ticket to the final eight, but he retained his 7th place today, which still leads him to London. The Czech is chasing a fifth consecutive appearance at the O2 Arena. Today's success means he now has 10 ATP titles and is the ninth tennis player to have more than one win in this tournament, which has been around for 45 years. <p/> ''This is the first and only tournament I have won at least twice. I really feel great here, the organisers take care of everything we need. That's the reason I keep coming back, I feel at home'', said the Czech tennis ace after his hard-fought victory. He could have saved the opening set in his favour when he served at 5-4, but Dimitrov had other plans. The Bulgarian stole a set from the Czech by winning four games in a row. Berdych did not make the same mistake in the second and third sets and took the break advantage safely to the end. <p/> ''I lost the opening set because Dimitrov played unbelievable. I was very happy with my serve in the second set, which helped me to finish well,'' explained the Czech. <p/> Tomas Berdych celebrates his second win in Stochholm and 10th of his career <p/> Grigor Dimitrov lost today, but is still in contention for the final in London. He is currently 11th in the ATP Race Rankings, 330 points behind Murray, who is still in eighth place, which is still enough to qualify. All credit to Tomas, it's tough after losing the final, but he was better'', said the Bulgarian, who will play in Basel next week, while Berdych will travel to Valencia.

__label__objective Origins <p/> Despite claims by the government of the People's Republic of China that Taiwan has always been part of China, its historical records do not record this. The earliest official records of Taiwan date back to the Three Kingdoms Period (222-280), when the first exploratory expedition of several thousand people was sent to the island from the Kingdom of Wu. However, in these records, Taiwan is identified as an area outside the boundaries of Chinese civilisation. When the island began to be colonised by foreign powers in the 16th century, the majority of the island's inhabitants were of Malayo-Polynesian origin, not of Han ethnicity. <p/>European trading bases (1624-1662) <p/>The first European conquerors to take an interest in Taiwan were the Portuguese, but they did not colonise the island. They called it Ihla Formosa, or Beautiful Island, and took the name with them to the world in the mid-16th century. The Dutch, who arrived from Indonesia and the Philippines in 1622, initially settled the Penghu Islands (Pescadores), where they established military rule. From there, they controlled maritime traffic in the Taiwan Strait and made passage difficult for Portuguese traders. In 1624, they were driven out by Ming troops and relocated to the main island of Taiwan. From Tainan, they dominated the south-western part of the island. The northern part of Taiwan was occupied by the Spanish conquistadors in 1626, but the Dutch drove them out in 1642. The Dutch government encouraged Chinese immigration to Taiwan because it needed a large labour force on the rice and sugar cane plantations. <p/>The Zheng family government (1662-1683) <p/> In China, Ming subjects fought against the Manchus, who gradually occupied China. In 1644, the Manchu Qing dynasty ruled China and the loyal Ming military forces fled to Taiwan. Commander Zheng Cheng-gong é­æå (Koxinga), who had settled in northern Taiwan, continued to fight the Manchus for almost two decades, with the aim of re-establishing the Ming dynasty in China. After several unsuccessful battles in China, in 1661 he rebelled against the Dutch government in Taiwan and negotiated an agreement to take power. 1662 saw the establishment of the Kingdom of Dongning æ±å¯§, which, after Koxinga's death, was ruled by a son and a grandson until 1683, when the Qing dynasty took power. At that time, Taiwan became administratively part of Fujian Province (èºç£åº) and thus part of the multi-ethnic Manchu Empire of the Qing Dynasty. <p/> Qing Dynasty (1683-1895) <p/> During this period, thousands of poor Chinese immigrants came to Taiwan in search of a new start and a better life. Most of them were employed on cane and rice plantations, which were the main export commodities. As a result of the Opium Wars (between 1839-42 and 1856-60), 4 Taiwanese ports were opened to foreign traders, making Taiwan increasingly attractive in international trade. Taiwanese sugar, camphor, indigo and tea were highly sought-after export commodities. During the Sino-French War of Vietnam (1884-5), the northern part of Taiwan was occupied by the French and it was only then that the Chinese court slowly became aware of the vulnerability of the Chinese coastline to attack by foreign forces and the strategic role Taiwan played in this. The signing of the armistice between France and the Qing dynasty was followed by a reorganisation of the political administration, making Taiwan an independent province of the Qing Empire in 1885. The provincial capital is moved from Tainan to Taipei, and gradually Taiwan becomes much stronger. <p/>Japanese rule (1895-1945) in Taiwan and developments on the mainland<p/> In 1894, the Japanese invasion of Korea, which the Qing dynasty regarded as its tributary state, sparked the first Sino-Japanese War. Under the harsh terms of the Shimonoseki Peace Treaty of 1895, which formally ended the war, Taiwan, together with the Penghu Islands, was handed over to Japan. The people of Taiwan were disappointed by the dynasty's decision and tried to fight the Japanese invaders on their own. They established the Republic of Taiwan èºç£æ°ä¸»å, which survived 5 months of fierce battles, from May to October 1895. <p/> During the 1950s, Japan carried out a systematic assimilation of the Taiwanese and rapidly developed the island's economy. Taiwan had by then developed the most modern industrial and transport infrastructure in Asia (except for Japan itself), which set the stage for Taiwan's further development. <p/> In China, however, disillusionment with Manchurian rule grew in the late 19th century. The political programme of the revolutionary Dr Sun Yat-sen (å­«é¸ä» Sun Yixian / å­«ä¸­å±± Sun Zhongshan), who fought for the overthrow of the Manchurian monarchy of the Qing dynasty, gradually gained increasing popular support. His political ideals were summed up in a doctrine called the "Three People's Principles" ä¸æ°ä¸»ç¾© (nationalism, democracy and national welfare), which aspired to an independent and democratic China. On 10 October 1911 (Xinhai Revolution è¾äº¥é©å½), Sun's military forces successfully captured the capital of Hubei province, Wuchang, and proclaimed secession from the Manchurian Qing dynasty. The revolution gradually engulfed the whole of central and southern China. These rebellious, south-central provinces declared independence and established an independent republic with Nanjing as its capital. The provisional government of the newly established Republic of China, headed by Sun Yatsen (his official enthronement as President on 1 January 1912 is considered as the founding day of the Republic of China and is still celebrated in Taiwan today), was very weak as the northern provinces were still loyal to the Manchurian Empire. In order to preserve national unity and avoid civil war, Sun renounced the presidency and offered it to the Northern Army General Yuan Shikai è¢ä¸å±, who on 12 February 1912 obtained the abdication of the last Manchurian Emperor, Xuantong å®£çµ±çå¸ (Puyi), ending the reign of the last dynasty in China. The Republic of China thus became the legitimate heir to the Qing territory, which at that time included Xinjiang, Tibet, Mongolia, and Manchuria (Taiwan was then still under Japan). Yuan Shikai soon disappointed the revolutionaries greatly. Instead of democracy and social reform, he sought to establish a new dynasty and the imperial throne, and to destroy the Party, thus completely flouting the Constitution of the Republic. Sun Yatsen therefore reorganised his alliance (the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance ä¸­ååçæ) into the Chinese Nationalist Party å æ° é»¨ (KMT). After a failed attempt at revolution again, he relocated to Japan, where he continued the revolution until Yuan's death in 1916. In 1917, he returned to Guangzhou and worked to reunite a completely fragmented China ruled by military strongmen. He founded the famous Huangpu é»å (Whampoa) military academy, which became a centre for raising a revolutionary army to reunify China. After Sun's death (1925), General Chiang Kai-shek (è£ä¸­æ­£ Jiang Zhongzheng / è£ä»ç³ Jiang Jieshi) took supreme command of the army. In his famous three-year military expedition to northern China, Chiang defeated many feudal lords and annexed the military provinces to the rule of the Republic of China. In March 1927, Nanjing was restored as the capital of the Republic of China, and with the capture of Beijing in 1928, Chiang triumphantly completed the Northern Expedition. Power over China thus passed to the Nationalists, but unification did not bring lasting peace. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), founded in 1921 and initially working with Chiang, was gaining more and more strength, and the ideological tensions between the two parties were becoming increasingly insurmountable. China was increasingly threatened by the danger of a Japanese invasion. <p/> Japan launched an attack on Manchuria in 1931, establishing a puppet state known as Manzhuguo æ»¿æ´²å. The last emperor of the Qing dynasty, Puyi, was chosen as the formal leader. For reasons of national interest, the Communists and Nationalists then reunited to fight the Japanese forces, but the cooperation was merely symbolic and there was no genuine truce between the two factions. The incident between Japanese and Chinese troops at the Marco Polo Bridge near Beijing in 1937 led to the Second Sino-Japanese War, which lasted for eight years, until the end of the Second World War. After the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, which ignited the Second World War, the Republic of China, which was on the side of the Allies, played the role of an important war front, receiving massive American aid. At the end of 1943, a declaration (the Cairo Declaration) was signed in Cairo by US President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and General Chiang Kaishek, in which the return of Manchuria, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands was assigned to the Republic of China. The Japanese surrender and the Postdam Declaration adopted in August 1945 gave legitimacy to the Cairo Declaration. The departure of the Japanese forces, however, refocused all the energies of the communists and nationalists on the battle for their own power. This gave the Chinese civil war full momentum. <p/>Republic of China power <p/> After the Japanese surrender in August 1945, the Nationalist ROK army, on behalf of the Allied Powers, invaded Taiwan and accepted the Japanese surrender. On 25 October 1945, Taiwan officially became part of the Republic of China. <p/> White Terror ç½è²ææ 1945-1972 <p/> The Taiwanese people were very happy to see the restoration of ties with the mainland, the departure of the Japanese army and the arrival of representatives of the Nationalist ROK government. However, relations between the Taiwanese people and the new immigrants from the Chinese mainland soon became strained. The priority of the ROC government was the conquest of the whole of China, while Taiwan and the local population were not of paramount importance to the government of the time. The early period of the ROC government in Taiwan was marked by corruption, illegal land grabbing, inflation, outbreaks of infectious diseases and shortages of basic goods. All of this consequently led to one of Taiwan's greatest tragedies: the 228 äºäºå«äºä»¶ Incident. The incident took place on 27 February 1947, when a woman illegally selling untaxed cigarettes on a street in Taipei was attempted to be punished by a group of police officers and agents of the Monopoly Bureau. The scuffle ended in a shoot-out in which a Taiwanese bystander was killed. Immediately, tensions arose between the discriminated civilian population on the one hand and the KMT civil servants on the other. <p/> The conflicts escalated into mass demonstrations, all of which were suppressed in blood. Thousands of Taiwanese, mainly educated people, were killed by government forces at the time. Although repression in the later period did not reach the level of 1947, political arrests and detentions were commonplace in Taiwan until the early 1970s. This period has therefore earned the name "beil terror". The incident planted the seeds of hatred between the locals and the newcomers, with far-reaching consequences for Taiwanese society. The newcomers made up only 15 % of the island's population, but for many years they maintained their superiority over the 85-strong native population. It was not until 1995 that the ROC-Nationalist Party government, headed by President Lee Teng-hui (æç»è¼ Li Denghui), formally apologised for the repression and passed a law to compensate all victims of the terror, declaring 28 February a public holiday two years later. <p/>ROC government relocation to Taiwan <p/> In 1949, the Nationalist troops in China were finally defeated. To escape the Communists, Chiang Kai-shek and his government took refuge in Taiwan with some 1.5 million supporters, where he established a new base for the R.C. On 1 October, Mao Zedong, the commander of the Communist troops, solemnly proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in Tiananmen Square. Thus was born the "two Chinas". Both governments, the PRC and the ROC, asserted their legitimacy over the territory of the whole of China. With the support of the USA, the ROC, as the legitimate representative of the whole of China, established close diplomatic relations with most of the democratic countries of the world and retained its seat at the United Nations until 1971, when the international situation turned in favour of the PRC. During this period, however, the political and economic development of the island, independent of the PRC, gradually transformed the Taiwanese people's self-conception of their identity and belonging.

__label__subjective Seventh Heaven <p/> 25.01.2008 <p/> "Fasten your seat belt and tighten your harness. Bring the helmet buckle together with the red buckle on your left seat belt strap. Lean into the carbon plate under your feet, but make sure you don't pinch the windscreen washer button, which is down there. We'll be bounced around a bit, but you can hold on to the roll cage with your hands," Nicolas explained to me as we prepared to start our adventure in the cockpit of the works car. <p/> No, it wasn't a flight in a military jet fighter, but the experience was very similar. Two adrenaline-fuelled men (well, at least one of them certainly was), both wearing flame-retardant pyjamas, helmets on their heads, strapped firmly into a clam seat, chatting in the cockpit of a hellishly expensive machine, surrounded by wires, switches, levers, monitors and carbon-fibre components. The hot, bare metal interior is permeated by the intoxicating, almost slightly intoxicating, smell of high-octane propellant. Mhm ... it really does smell like mint tea. How soothing and calming. It should also be prescribed drop by drop in pharmacies to all petrol addicted racing drivers and journalists. <p/> When the cabin door closes, a mad but sadly all too brief adventure begins, which is actually akin to driving a jet fighter. With one difference. That, of course, those of us who have had the opportunity to ride in a jet military aircraft are, after all, outnumbered by those of us who have sat behind the wheel or in the passenger seat of such a vehicle. In Russia, for many years now, it has been possible to take a ride in a MiG, and at the airport in Slovenj Grad it is also possible to buy a ticket for a ride in a south-eastern seagull. <p/> You cannot buy a ride in a Peugeot 307 WRC. For no money. Especially not a drive in a factory car, behind the wheel of which, just a few days ago, former World Rally Champion Marcus Gronholm was still sitting. Well, it's true that it is possible to buy a 307 WRC, or it will be possible next season. But it's also true that you will only be able to get your hands on this car with good connections and if you have at least a few virtuoso drives or if you can boast World Rally Championship-level results beforehand. <p/> Well, then, you are only a modest few hundred thousand euros away from buying such a hand-built racing car. The official figure, according to the men from Peugeot's motorsport department, is between 700 thousand and a million euros. But as one local racing driver said, once you've bought the car, all you need is a bucket and a cloth. At least to clean it every now and then, because you're not going to drive it anyway. Unless you've also bought, for almost the same amount, the spare parts and the big truckload of equipment needed to maintain such a race car. And you need a team of four or five mechanics (read engineers) who are skilled in maintaining, servicing and handling this sophisticated apparatus on four wheels. <p/> Jeep, the Peugeot 307 WRC is no longer just a racing car. It's a top-quality machine for achieving the highest goals. It is a machine for winning rallies in the World Rally Championship. <Let's get back in the car! Having driven a few laps of Peugeot's previous 206 world rally car on this same circuit two years ago, I kind of knew what to expect. Well, at least I had a hunch, unlike Avtomagazin's Dusan and Alyosha, who were about to be baptised by fire. Several years of active participation in the domestic rally championship, and two years as a co-driver before that, had given me the courage to sit in the passenger seat for the three demonstration laps, completely relaxed and smiling ear to ear. To see what a little Frenchman can do behind the wheel of a big Frenchman. Come on, poba, scare me if you can, I thought, because the man doesn't know anyway that I'm no stranger to racing and that I've driven a similar car on this very track. <p/> But my smile and my courage did not last long. Even though I knew that the car allowed everything that was already beyond the limits of what was possible and had nothing to do with the law of gravity and the rest of physics, after the first metres and the turns, I was breathless. No, I wasn't afraid that something would go wrong, because I trusted the driver, the car and the safety of the track. I was more amazed at what the car really could do and how docilely controllable it was in the hands of a true master. You know, when you're behind the wheel yourself, the first thing you want to do is to get the whole car back, because the Peugeot people wouldn't be too impressed if I tipped their toy on the roof. The question is whether, after such a misfortune, they would have let me get behind the wheel of, say, a 308 WRC in 2008. <p/> After half a lap I started to enjoy it again. With one eye on the track in front of us, I was watching to see if the owners had changed any of the corners in two years, and with the other eye I was watching Vouilloso twisting the steering wheel, when to change gear, when to apply the handbrake, how he was pressing on the accelerator, whether he was braking with his left foot or his right foot, and so on. Our two laps were over too quickly, but I was quite happy. It was a pure pleasure to drive, but the fact that we finished meant something completely different. That we were going to change seats. For the next three laps, the little Frenchman goes into the passenger seat, and I cram myself into a seat that is too narrow, the steering wheel too long. To give him back his dear soap. <p/> The journalist colleagues in front of me have already worn out the Michelin racing tyres for the gravel, so Nicolas motions for me to pit. <p/> "Let's get a fresh set of tyres and refuel," he says, and it occurs to me that sometimes it's not a bad idea to be last in line. New tyres! Yes, when I'm racing alone, I hear that word too rarely, unfortunately. Meanwhile, I pull the Peugeot into the red service area and the engineers roll out a set of new tyres from the big service truck, which is resplendent with stars and wreaths indicating the number of World Championship wins. Mhm, just for me. And I'm enjoying every moment. <p/> The vehicle is lifted onto four special pedestals by two cranes and all four wheels are taken off at the same time. The four of them struggle to replace them and all I hear behind the wheel is the shrill beeping of the electric wheel-bolting guns. The head of engineering lifts the bonnet and plugs in a laptop computer, checking that the engine is OK. <p/> And I am still sitting behind the wheel, waiting for the team to do their job. The guys wipe down the windows, scrape the mud, soil and stones that have accumulated around the wheels off the undercarriage and, in the meantime, someone opens the tailgate and uses a pump to pump high-octane, highly flammable, fast-burning, volatile racing petrol into the car's fuel tank. <p/> Mama mia, if only moments like that lasted forever! Can you imagine how soothing such a situation is for the ego of a casual and hobby racer from the sunny side of the Alps? ! Like valerian drops. Sitting in the factory car of a former world champion, with the team around you trying to prepare the car for your drive, while you chat about the car's special features with your co-driver, the guy who stunned the world this year with a great drive and top times in the Rally de Catalunya. Yah, and what good does that do him? He can still just be my co-driver! <p/> Joke aside: Nicolas Vouilloz is a nice man. The multiple world downhill mountain bike champion has a two-year contract with Peugeot. He competes in eight World Championship rallies in last year's 206 WRC under the Peugeot factory team. The world got to know him at this year's Rally de Catalunya, where he finished 10th overall and twice finished second on stages, once just three tenths of a second behind the winner. Talent! The driver of the future? Undoubtedly, as he was also behind multiple World Champion and reigning champion Peter Solberg and this year's champion Sebastjan Loeb. <p/> Nicolas tells me to pull the metal lever on the steering wheel quickly and hard towards me. The car twitches slightly and a big orange R appears on the screen in front of the driver. I move the same lever away from the steering wheel. I pull the lever. Position 1. First gear. Let's go. Slowly to the racetrack. I look at my co-driver, who knows exactly what I'm interested in. <p/> He just nods his head. You can do it! Greeemooooooooo! Gaaaas! Jihaaaaaaa! The cake goes off like a cannon. With two carbon rings on the steering wheel, you shift up and down with just the finger of one hand. It's just like Formula 1, but instead of buttons on the steering wheel, there's a ring. Why? Because you have to turn the steering wheel rapidly as the car slides sideways through corners, and the gearshift button is always close at hand. That way, the steering wheel is always in place in any position. Where you need it. <p/> After the first lap, my co-driver opened the door to a world of heaven by moving the knob on the centre console two laps. He switched the engine electronics programme from the stage position to the post-stage position. The car breathed at the top of its lungs. The loud popping of the electronics of the turbine-powered vehicles was virtually inaudible in the car. Only the electronic hiss and shifting of the turbo gearbox, combined with the waterfalls of rocks loudly blasting the bottom of the car as the wheels spin idle under the sheer force of the power, caress the ears. <p/> The Peugeot soars over rough potholes. And every new gear is rewarded with a jolt to the shin and a new sticking of both occupants deep into the racing seat. By far the most impressive thing about the car is the insanely good chassis. It absorbs potholes you think will rip the wheels off and makes sure that even on long jumps, the car lands unfeelingly on the wheels. Crazy! The brakes are the same, stopping the car at 100 or 130 km/h before a corner as if it were cemented in place, after just a gentle touch of the racing shoe. And that's on gravel. <p/> I can say that I have never driven a more drivable, more beautiful, more docile and predictable car. The 307 WRC is a true special, a car that drives itself. Well, just the wrong way. In fact, it's the only car that really is driven by the driver, not the other way around. Once you get a taste of this machine, you realise that in a "civilian" car, the car is still being driven by the driver, who is trying very hard to keep it on the road. <p/> It is a testament to how tame this beast can be that, believe it or not, during our drive, my co-driver, the very saintly Nicolas Vouilloz, also grabbed the safety cage firmly with his right hand on several occasions, and unexpectedly hissed "ssssssssss" through his teeth into my intercom, which could only mean that the boy does not like to ride in the passenger seat very much, or that I was unexpectedly fast in certain corners, even for such a master of the steering wheel. Yes, you'll never imagine what a great compliment it is for a racing driver when such a master inadvertently utters, "Ssssss! " <p/> And so we're driving home in a 90-horsepower diesel, lazily making our way along the straight highways of France, Germany and Austria to Ljubljana, when my TV colleague Stropnik throws me a bone: "Dude, what fools we are! We are driving 1300 kilometres there and 1300 kilometres back. We spend two days in the car and a lot of money on fuel and tolls. All to drive three laps there - in the car! Who can understand that? At least if you were there after driving for twelve hours, you could run around for three laps or ride a bicycle, instead of just getting in another car, doing three laps and then skating home for another twelve hours..." <p/> Hm, actually David is quite right. We are indeed weirdos, but at the same time I know very well that he thinks exactly the same as me. For three more laps in that car, we'd turn back again in a heartbeat... <p/> ID card <p/> Title: Peugeot 307 WRC (world rally car) <p/> Year built: 2004 <p/> Owner: Peugeot Motorsport France <p/> Number of examples in existence: 2 registered, about 6 built <p/> Driver: Marcus Gronholm <p/> Price: not for sale <p/> Value: â¬800,000 to â¬1,000,000 <p/> Mission: to win individual events and the world rally championship

The point is plain to the eye, you tell yourself. That's why you don't look guys in the eye, you look at the bulge above their balls, you shave the longest ones in your wet dreams, you suck on the fattest ones, and your pussy always has that empty feeling that it's missing a massive chunk of meat. One giant fella. She can never have enough love. <p/> Until you catch yourself on a tiny hook. On an unpromising techie who sticks in your mouth like some phallic superhero. Who can triple, triple, quadruple, quadruple himself to plough me like some John Deree (yep, tractor) and leave me sore with pleasure, drunk with power. In the arms of a random lover with a purpose. To teach me how the small things grow big, and the big things don't necessarily grow bigger, but sometimes barely. <p/> Oh, this empire of flesh! The horizons that open up when you see one great potential in all that is between their legs. In the short, fat one, placed between the two pouches like a half-smoked, badly rolled cigar. In the bald eagle of scarlet robes that keeps pulling him from the centre to somewhere to the left. In a thin isolation in the middle of naked nakedness. They are mighty prospects and poisons in little bottles and they are cute cripples who don't need crutches to walk. Just me, hot and willing. <p/> So now I look them in the eye and blindly take what's under my belt. Without prejudice. Whoever wants to see must know when to open their eyes.

__label__subjective 8 comments <p/> Hehe, I see you had a lot of "fun" finding the right spoke. I'm curious to know how shit I'm going to be when the first one on my new bayko breaks. I have a wheelset Mavic Crossride with flat spokes :-) I have also noticed that they are mostly 2mm and I have also seen 2,2. But they usually come in silver or black. Last time I was shopping in a shop in Litija in LJ (I won't advertise) I even got black nipples for 2mm, but luckily they gave me one nipple over, because it turned out that one of them was without a thread :-) <p/> Yeah, you'll probably have a lot of fun with that too. I find it very sad, though. I have no words at all. At least for the bikes they sell, they could have stock for all models, even past ones. I couldn't choose the colour, although black would have been spot on as you can see from the video. <p/> In principle, they have spokes in all bike shops, if they have a bike service next door. If they have a spoke that is the same as yours is another question. If your spoke thickness is the classic 2.0 mm there should be no problem, you just need to find out the length. <p/> Hi David, if you have a cracked spoke on the gear side you will have to remove them. otherwise it won't be possible. Removing the gears is quite easy, but it is true that you need tools. You can see how to remove the gears in this video http://bikebook.si/2011/03/zadnje-pesto-shimano-xt/
__label__objective Since we were extremely lucky to have BoÅ¡tjan Romih visit us at the faculty and give us a very entertaining lecture on oratory and public speaking, here are some pointers that I found most useful and interesting. <p/> As we know, eye contact is the cornerstone of contact and there are two principles to be observed in relation to it: uniformity and randomness. It is therefore necessary to be careful to look at each listener for approximately the same amount of time. At the same time, we need to avoid patterns that could be picked up by the listeners. <p/> When speaking, we should also not apologise in advance (e.g. I apologise in advance for not having had time to prepare well for the talk. ). It is very likely that listeners/viewers will then only be more aware of our mistakes. When public speaking, we also avoid smiling to show fear and discomfort (no smile is preferable to being forced). <p/> When speaking in public, we often don't know where to put our hands. It is best to position them at belly button height (more chance of actually using them than if they are hanging by the body). Markers, power point remotes, sheets of paper (but they should be smaller - e.g. A5, and the notes should be legible and in a large enough font) can help as a fixation point. But then we have to make sure that we gesticulate with the hand that is free, and that we are not holding these tools. <p/> If you want to practise speaking with distinctness, try speaking with a pencil between your teeth.
__label__objective Ombudsman <p/> ÄP <p/> Consistency in responding and length of inspection procedures also at local level remains a problem <p/> The Ombudsman of the Republic of Slovenia found that the Inter-municipal Inspectorate of the Joint Municipal Administration - 5G violated the principle of good administration by failing to respond to the petitioner, who had submitted several reports to it, in accordance with Article 17 of the Regulation on Administrative Operations, and by inexplicably failing to follow up on the petitioner's request for a tailored method of communication. The inspection of the petitioner's first complaint was carried out one day before the reply of the Inter-municipal Inspectorate to the Ombudsman and almost 11 months after the complaint, which the Ombudsman considers to be an unacceptable length of time. Both the inspection procedure concerning the petitioner's first and second complaint are still pending. <p/> * * * * <p/> The Ombudsman of the Republic of Slovenia (the Ombudsman) dealt with the petitioner's petition concerning the alleged pollution of her property with various sewage and waste. The petitioner informed the Ombudsman that she addressed her letters and complaints to, inter alia, the Municipality of Å kofljica (the Municipality) and the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate and Redarstvo of the Municipalities of Grosuplje, Ig and Å kofljica (the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate).The tasks of the Inter-Munial Inspectorate were in the meantime taken over by the Joint Municipal Administration 5G, within which the current Inter-Munial Inspectorate operates. <p/> The Ombudsman has not found any irregularities in the conduct of the Municipality, which received the petitioner's communication for information only and therefore did not respond to it. <p/> According to the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate, it received the petitioner's complaint on 24 June 2019 regarding the pollution of her property with waste water allegedly caused by the owners of neighbouring properties, and an inspection was to be carried out on 22 June 2020, but it has not yet informed the petitioner of its findings pursuant to Article 24 of the Inspection Control Act (ICA). He is expected to do so at the end of the procedure, which leads the Ombudsman to conclude that the inspection procedure has not yet been completed. <p/> In the past year, the petitioner submitted two reports to the Inter-municipal Inspectorate. The first report, concerning construction waste dumped on her property, was received by the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate from the Ljubljana-ViÄ Police Station on 19 May 2020. The Inter-Municipal Inspectorate referred this report to the Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia for the Environment and Spatial Planning (IRSOP), which informed the petitioner and the Ombudsman. A second complaint by the petitioner concerning the alteration of nature trails was received by the Inter-municipal Inspectorate on 27 May 2020 and referred to the IRSOP. An inspection has not yet been carried out in this respect. <p/> Taking into account all available documentation, the Ombudsman found that the inspection of the petitioner's first complaint was carried out one day before the Inter-municipal Inspectorate's reply to the Ombudsman and almost 11 months after the complaint, which we considered to be unacceptably late. We pointed out to the Inter-municipal Inspectorate that, while it is true that, in accordance with Article 4 of the CPC, inspectors are independent in carrying out inspection tasks within the scope of their powers and that inspection procedures are (primarily) procedures in the public interest, this does not in itself justify significant delays such as those experienced in the specific case. We have also clarified that Article 24 of the CPC does not constitute an obstacle to the inspector informing the notifier of his actions at an earlier stage in the light of the principle of good administration, nor does it relieve the inspector of his obligation based on the provision of the first proviso to Article 17(1) of the CPC to inform the notifier of his actions at an earlier stage. The Inspector is not under any obligation under Article 17 of the Administrative Procedure Regulation (APR), according to which the authority is obliged to reply to all correspondence from which it can be inferred that the authority expects a reply and the identity of the sender, unless the content of the correspondence relates to a procedure pending before the authority, the correspondence is vexatious, or the authority has already replied to the sender on a substantially similar issue. The Authority is obliged to reply, in accordance with the second paragraph of that Article, no later than 15 days after receipt of the document, to the address indicated in the letter. On the basis of the reply received from the Inter-municipal Inspectorate, we conclude that the petitioner did not receive such a notification. In addition to the above, the Ombudsman also noted that, although the Inter-municipal Inspectorate had informed the petitioner of its decision to withdraw the notification to the IRSOP, it had not followed her request for an adapted method of communication. After further enquiries by the Ombudsman, the Inter-municipal Inspectorate agreed that, in accordance with the UUP, it should have dealt with the cases as quickly as possible and replied to all correspondence within 15 days. However, in his opinion, this is not always possible, mainly due to the large number of reports received, the work priorities, as well as the prolonged sick leave. He stressed that the risk assessment, the public interest and the nature of the infringement must be taken into account when dealing with reports, the conduct of inspection procedures and the criteria for setting priorities, and was aware that this was not a sufficient justification. As regards the follow-up of the procedure, the Inter-municipal Inspectorate stated that it had been in contact with the petitioner by telephone and that a joint field visit would be carried out as soon as possible in the light of the petitioner's possibilities. <p/> The Ombudsman considered the response of the Inter-municipal Inspectorate, assuming the veracity of its allegations, to be adequate, but at the same time expressed doubts that a positive development in the specific case would have taken place even without its intervention. The Ombudsman has been drawing attention to the lengthy nature of inspection procedures at both national and local level for many years, but unfortunately, despite the Ombudsman's repeated appeals, progress cannot be assessed as satisfactory. In any case, the large number of cases handled by the average inspector cannot be ignored, taking into account the already chronic staff shortage in all inspectorates. This does not, of course, in itself justify the lengthy decision-making process in this case and in many others. <p/> In conclusion, the Ombudsman expressed the expectation that, taking into account all the relevant circumstances, the Inter-municipal Inspectorate would conclude both inspection proceedings within a reasonable time and that it would inform the petitioner of its findings in a manner that would be appropriate for her, at the latest at the end of the proceedings. The Ombudsman considers the present petition to be well-founded and has found a breach of the principle of good administration.

__label__subjective Trampling on the Constitution instead of taking responsibility <p/> The Information Commissioner has caught the police illegally obtaining data on the readers of online portals. Instead of taking responsibility, the ministry wants to legalise the actions of the police. Even though they are against the Constitution. <p/> If someone is warned that his actions are breaking the law, if he is reasonable, he will stop those actions. The police and the Ministry of the Interior see things slightly differently - instead of stopping illegal activities, they would legalise them. Even if this legalisation is contrary to the Constitution. <p/> But let us take it in turn. In January this year, we published a report by the Information Commissioner on the podcrto.si website, which found repeated illegal behaviour by the police in obtaining data from web portal operators. In the vast majority of cases, the police have requested information on the identity of readers and commenters on online portals from portal operators without a court order. However, the Act on Electronic Commerce on the Market stipulates that the police can only obtain such information with a court order. However, according to the Information Commissioner's findings, in 2012 the police obtained information on readers only four times with a court order. In the remaining 31 cases, it requested it bypassing the courts. <p/> Much of the media did not pay attention to these findings. This is understandable - in 23 cases, the media operating online portals provided the police with the identity of their readers, even though they did not have a court order to do so. In this way, they themselves were complicit in breaking the law. <p/> What is more surprising is the reaction of the police and the Ministry of the Interior, which is the superior authority of the police. Instead of holding the police accountable and punishing the guilty for repeatedly breaking the law, they have responded to the Information Commissioner's findings by creatively interpreting the law, which may, after all, allow them to obtain information bypassing the courts. This is how they brought to light Article 149b of the Criminal Procedure Act. The third paragraph of this article gives the police the possibility to request from operators, only at their written request, information on the owner or user of a particular means of electronic communications traffic which is not published in the subscriber directories. The intention behind the legal latitude is simple: the legislator wanted to make the police's job easier in cases where the police have the telephone number of a suspect but cannot find out his name because the number is not in the telephone directory. However, the police and the Ministry of the Interior have interpreted the provision creatively: operators of online portals could also be considered operators, and therefore they are obliged to provide data even without a court order. <p/> This lifeline of the police was eventually broken by the latter, after a series of correspondence between the Ministries of Justice, Economy and Higher Education, Science and Technology to establish the definition of an operator. It said that the Electronic Communications Act defines an operator as someone who manages a communications network. This, of course, is not what the web portals do. The MoI has now run out of excuses, and so at the end of February it admitted to the Information Commissioner that in almost all cases of data extraction the police had acted illegally. <p/> But the story does not end here. The MoI has decided to legalise the illegal activities of the police. By amending the Criminal Procedure Act (ZKP). The proposed amendment to the CCP, which is currently undergoing inter-ministerial coordination, would thus include service providers in the aforementioned Article 149b(3). According to the interpretation of the MoI, this would also require operators of web portals to provide information to the police only upon written request. This would make the hitherto unlawful practice legal. <p/> But there is one problem with this argument - the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia. As the Information Commissioner points out, Article 37 of the Constitution guarantees the secrecy of letters and other communications, and only the law may prescribe that, on the basis of a court decision, the protection of the secrecy of letters and other communications and the inviolability of human privacy may be waived for a certain period of time if this is necessary for the initiation or conduct of a criminal proceeding or for the security of the state. Furthermore, in its 1997 decision, the Constitutional Court ruled that it is not only the content of the communication, i.e. the content of a letter, that is guaranteed, but also the circumstances of the communication, i.e. who communicated with whom and when. Thus, information about who accessed or commented on an internet portal is also constitutionally protected communication data. The police can therefore only obtain it by court order, no matter what law they write. This is because the Constitution, as the supreme law, is above the law. And given the experience of the Yugoslav secret services, it is understandable why the Constitution is so strict about obtaining communications data. <p/> The intentions of the police or the Ministry of the Interior in amending the Criminal Procedure Act are therefore worrying. Not so much from the point of view of the authorities' desire to make it easier to obtain data on the readers of online portals, but because of the intention to blatantly flout constitutional provisions. The latter are the cornerstone of the rule of law, and trampling on them puts us as a society in great danger. <p/> Therefore, if law enforcement authorities wish to obtain communications data bypassing the courts, they should pursue this desire through legal channels. By proposing an amendment to the Constitution. This route is, of course, infinitely more difficult than amending the law - it requires the consent of two-thirds of the members of the National Assembly. But it is the only permissible one. And it is the only one that would trigger a proper public debate on the proposed amendments. <p/> If the proposed amendment to the CPC were nevertheless adopted, and the police then started to obtain communications data bypassing the courts, in violation of constitutional provisions, we would face another problem. Evidence obtained in this way will not be taken into account by the courts, as it will have been obtained illegally. For example, the actors in the Balkan Warrior case were acquitted because of illegally obtained evidence. In court, the police were unable to explain how they obtained the telephone numbers of the defendants, who were then wiretapped. The numbers were not made public. Under the Constitution, it would have had to prove that it had obtained them legally - either by court order from the mobile phone operator or by some other legal means, such as from police colleagues. The judges then ruled as they were obliged to do under the Constitution and the law. They threw out the illegally obtained wiretaps and acquitted most of the defendants. According to the then Director of the Criminal Police Directorate, Jurij Fermet, the police were "shocked" by the verdict. Well, history is repeating itself now, and new shocks seem to be just around the next corner.

__label__objective Even today - despite the strong influence of school and environment - what Jernej Pavlin wrote more than sixty years ago at the beginning of his story about today's Godovnjak is true: "What children will ever be like depends most on their upbringing in the home. "He adds, "Holy parents sometimes have holy children. "She is thinking of Brigitta of Sweden, the mystical wife and great saint whose daughter was St Catherine of Sweden, or Karin, whom the Church remembers today. <p/> Karin was the fourth of Brigitta's eight children. She was born in 1331 or 1332. She was put into a convent early on to be brought up. At her father's request, she married a pious nobleman when she was only fourteen. The young couple decided to imitate the virginal marriage of the Blessed Virgin and Saint Joseph. Catherine began to dress simply and without excessive jewellery. Her example was imitated by many young ladies, her friends. Her mother, Brigitta, went to Rome after her husband's death and lived a pious life there. Catherine's desire for Rome was also aroused. Her husband defended her at first, but finally gave her permission. Because of his illness, he was unable to accompany her. She came to Rome in 1349, when she was eighteen. She was happy to embrace her mother again. Soon, however, she felt very homesick and was about to return home. At her mother's request, she declared that she was ready to leave everything and stay in Rome for Christ's sake, but she soon came to despise Rome outright and asked her mother's permission to return to Sweden after all. Brigitta considered her daughter's wish a dangerous temptation, and she began to pray. Christ appeared to her and said, "Tell your daughter that she is already a widow. Convince her to stay. I will take care of her. "After a long time, Catherine found inner peace. Her mother's spiritual director also guided her, and under his guidance she progressed in virtue because she was obedient to him in everything. She made several pilgrimages with her mother, including one to the Holy Land in 1372. They both had a kind of monastic life, in which prayer, work, rest and charity were interspersed. Her mother Brigitta, in a vision, was ordered to found a new order with its first monastery in Vadstena, Sweden, as early as 1346. She also drew up the rules of the order, which is called the Order of Brigitta or the Order of the Saviour, but it was not until her daughter Catherine that her idea could be realised. <p/> Shortly after her return from the Holy Land, her mother died in Rome on 23 July 1373. According to her will, Catherine transported her body to Sweden, where it was solemnly buried in the monastery church in Vadstena. The nuns of this monastery lived according to the rules of her mother and elected Catherine as superior. But after only a year, she travelled to Rome to seek the leadership of the Catholic Church to have Brigitta declared a saint. She spent five years gathering the necessary material, then returned to Vadstena, where the bishop confirmed her as superior, and she began to prepare for her death: she died on 24 March 1381. Her canonization was confirmed by Pope Innocent VIII in 1484, and her mother Brigitta was declared a saint in 1391.

Much has been written about the problems of the unemployed. Including that over time they get used to vegetating in miserable conditions and re-employment terrifies them. So they would stay connected to work and people. <p/> -because it is right that everyone who is able to work should contribute as much as they can <p/> -because there are individuals who have built their own little world in which they parasitise on their parents, grandparents and friends. Parents do not resist them because of the guilt of having "brought up" such an individual, but also because they do not want to admit that they are part of the problem at home. Some individuals are also violent, which makes their parents give in. <p/> -because every individual has financial needs and, of course, spending needs, because they do not live on air. So he also has an income. Untaxed, of course. <p/> -because there are individuals who, although they work for nothing, do not contribute. Four hours of work a day would cause at least some to weigh up whether it might not be better to find other, declared work that better suits their needs <p/> -because it would make a universal basic income much fairer to those who are already in full-time employment <p/> -because there is enough work to go around.

__label__objective As regards the mental anguish resulting from reduced activity in life, it cannot be disregarded that, according to the expert's findings, only 20 % of the applicant's incapacity for work is due to the injuries sustained by the applicant in the present accident, and 80 % is attributable to a pre-existing medical condition. In this respect, the issue is one of shared causation. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> The review is dismissed. <p/> Reasons <p/> The Court of First Instance rules that the defendant must pay the applicant SIT 2 460 020 in damages, with statutory default interest from SIT 36 660 from 1.4.1998 until payment, from SIT 3 360 from 21.7.1998 until payment and from SIT 2 300 000 from 7.3.2003 until payment. It further ordered the defendant to pay the applicant an annuity of SIT 2 000 per month from 1.4.2003 by the 15th day of each month for the preceding month. The Court dismissed the applicant's claim for higher relief. It held that the defendant was strictly liable for the damage suffered by the applicant in the accident of 28.1.1998. It awarded the injured party damages of SIT 900 000 for the physical pain suffered, SIT 200 000 for the fear, SIT 1 000 000 for the mental pain resulting from the impairment of his activity in life and SIT 200 000 for the mental pain resulting from the disfigurement. <p/> The Court of Appeal partially upheld the litigants' appeals and amended the judgment of the Court of First Instance by awarding the applicant, in respect of non-pecuniary damage, pecuniary damages of SIT 2 500 000, with default interest from 1 January 2002 to 7 March 2003 at the statutory default interest rate less the base rate, and from 8 March 2003 at the statutory default interest rate. The Court of First Instance dismissed the appeals and upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance in all other respects. It accepted the applicant's plea that the compensation for mental pain and suffering as a result of the injury was too low and awarded her SIT 400 000 for that purpose, while it considered the compensation for the other forms of non-pecuniary damage awarded to the injured party by the Court of First Instance to be appropriate. <p/> The applicant brought an appeal against that judgment on the ground of error of substantive law. The applicant requests the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia to uphold it and to amend the judgment under appeal, in so far as it rejects the application, by awarding the applicant, in addition to the pecuniary damages of SIT 2 660 020 already awarded, SIT 2 000 000, with statutory default interest from 14.10.1999 until payment, and statutory default interest on the damages already awarded from 14.10.1999 until 31.12.2001. The applicant submits that, although the lower courts correctly established the factual situation, they subsequently awarded the injured party inadequate compensation for all forms of non-pecuniary damage. In awarding damages for the mental anguish resulting from the impairment of the applicant's activities in life, the Court of First Instance should not have followed uncritically the expert opinion of Dr W. that the applicant's classification as a category III invalid was only 20 % due to the physical injuries sustained in the accident and 80 % due to his medical condition. It was only as a result of the permanent consequences of the injuries sustained on 28.1.1998 that the applicant was classified in category III of invalidity, since he was no longer able to work. He was 48 years old at the time of the incident and will therefore have to endure the mental pain of reduced activity for a very long time. The Courts of First and Second Instance ignored the fact that the accident occurred in 1998 and that the defendant has not yet paid any compensation to the applicant. The decision on the commencement of interest on the pecuniary compensation for non-material damage is also incorrect. Neither the Law on Obligatory Relations (Official Gazette of the SFRY, No 29/78-57/89, ZOR) nor any other law provides that interest on compensation for non-material damage is payable to the injured party only from 1 January 2002. In view of the stabilised economic and economic situation in the country, the monetary claim for compensation for non-material damage is payable after the expiry of a period of 14 days from the date on which the defendant received the claim and the documentation. The applicant sent the claim to the defendant on 29.7.1998 and the defendant received it on 30.7.1998, and has therefore been in default of payment since 13.8.1998. According to Article 277 of the Civil Code, a debtor who defaults in the performance of a pecuniary obligation owes interest in addition to the principal. The case-law to date has neglected the function of interest, which consists in the penalty for failure to comply with a monetary obligation in time. Such a decision is contrary to Article 17(1), (12), and Article 919(1) and (3) of the Civil Code. <p/> The review was served on the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Slovenia and on the defendant, who did not reply to it. <p/> The audit is not substantiated. <p/> Pursuant to Article 370(3) of the Civil Procedure Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 36/04 - Official Journal of the Republic of Slovenia, p. 36), the review court and the parties are bound by the factual basis arising from the grounds of the judgments of first and second instance, and therefore, pursuant to Article 371 of the Civil Procedure Act, the review court examined the contested judgment within the limits of the ground raised by the reviser, namely error of substantive law. <p/> The fundamental principles governing the assessment of compensation for non-material damage are the principle of individualisation and the principle of objective conditionality of the amount of financial compensation. The principle of individualisation requires the determination of fair compensation in the light of the intensity (degree) and duration of the physical and mental pain and suffering and distress in the light of all the concrete circumstances of the individual victim. However, in accordance with the principle of the objective conditionality of the amount of pecuniary compensation, the court, in assessing it, must have regard to the importance of the good affected and the purpose of the compensation, and must ensure that it does not give way to tendencies incompatible with its nature and social purpose (Article 200(1) and (2) of the CPA). The Court of Second Instance, by awarding damages for physical pain (SIT 900 000), fear (SIT 200 000), mental pain due to the impairment of life activities (SIT 1 000 000) and mental pain due to disfigurement (SIT 400 000), found that the Court of First Instance had failed to award damages for the following reasons000) correctly met the legal standard of just pecuniary compensation, since the damages awarded are comparable to those awarded for similar harm and take into account all the applicant's individual characteristics, including her age at the time of the harmful event (see the reasons for the judgment of the Court of First Instance on pages 6 to 8 and the reasons for the judgment of the Court of Second Instance on page 3). As regards the mental pain resulting from reduced activity in life, it cannot be disregarded that, according to the expert's findings, only 20 % of the applicant's incapacity for work is due to the physical injuries sustained by the applicant in the present accident, and 80 % is attributable to a pre-existing medical condition. In that respect, the question of shared causation is one which the courts of the lower instances have resolved correctly in substantive law and in accordance with settled case-law. Since the applicant's current state of health or incapacity for work is also due to health problems which pre-date the harmful event, the defendant cannot be held liable for that part of the damage which is not attributable to the conduct of its insured. (1) <p/> The decision as to the commencement of interest is also substantively correct. The Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia, in a legal opinion of principle of 26.6.2002, adopted a position which ties the commencement of statutory default interest on a pecuniary claim for non-pecuniary damage (Articles 179-183 of the Law on Obligations, Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 83/01, OZ, or Articles 200-203 of the Civil Code) to the entry into force of the OZ (1.1.2002), provided that an additional condition of delay in performance on the part of the person who caused the damage is also met at the same time. The applicant's legal position, which considers that it is in any event decisive when the insurer received the claim for compensation with the applicant's medical records, referring to the provisions of Articles 12, 17(1), 277 and 919(1) and (3) of the Civil Code, is erroneous, since it would lead to unequal treatment of the injured party, contrary to the constitutional principle of equality (Article 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia) and to the principle of equal protection of the rights of the injured party (Article 22 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia). <p/> The reality in the field of compensation litigation is that courts generally award compensation several years after a claim has been lodged. This reality means that, in the area of data on damages awarded by the courts, they reflect, among other things, a measure of the time lag between the moment of the decision and the occurrence of the damage. In other words, the amounts of damages awarded, which the Court used for comparison purposes, also took into account the factor of waiting for compensation as an important element. <p/> Since neither the grounds on which the revision was brought nor the grounds which the Court of Review is required to take into account of its own motion are present, the Court of Review dismissed the revision (Article 378 of the Civil Procedure Code). <p/> Footnote (1): The case-law on the issue of shared causation has been settled by a legal opinion adopted at the General Session of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia on 15.12.1998, Legal Opinions II/98, page 12.
__label__objective Mole <p/> Mole <p/> The common or European mole (scientific name Talpa europaea) is a species of insectivore adapted to life underground. It rarely comes to the surface except during dry periods when it goes in search of water. Signs of its presence are moles. <p/> Mole shrews are active both during the day and at night, constantly searching for food. They dig tunnels at different depths. If the tunnel is just below the surface, it starts to throw soil to the surface, creating a mole. The tunnels can be 30 to 50 metres long. When looking for food, it runs through the tunnels for four hours and then rests for the same amount of time. Although the tunnels of different moles may be intertwined, they avoid each other, especially outside mating season. If they do meet, a fierce fight ensues, which can lead to death. Scientists hypothesise that moles also mark their territory by scent-marking the ground from the musk glands located on their abdomens. It is only during mating season that the male seeks out the female. After mating, the male leaves the female to care for the young. <p/> It feeds mainly on earthworms, although it will not give up insects and snails. The mole needs a lot of food and eats half its own weight daily. The greyhound does not have a well-developed sense of hearing and smell, but can still detect food and water at long distances. Because it lives underground in the dark, it does not need good eyesight. However, it has a well-developed sense of smell and can detect very faint vibrations. Its muzzle is covered with hairs, which help it to find prey. The mole has more sense organs than any mammal. We know very little about its sense organs. Because they cause damage to meadows and fields, farmers often kill them. <p/> The mating season of moles is very short. The male seeks out the female underground, where they mate. The male then leaves the female and is no longer interested in the fetus. Gestation lasts for one month. Three or four young are born between May and July in a nest for which the female has built a special room. They are naked when they are born, but after 24 days they have grown fur. They can leave the nest after 35 days to find their own territory. <p/> Protection <p/> In Slovenia, moles are protected and deterrents are used to combat them. We have developed an extremely effective and natural deterrent, Celaflor Mole Repellent, in the form of beads with the active ingredient methylnonylon ketone. It is completely harmless to humans and animals. It is important to follow the instructions on the product and to allow the mole to escape from your garden (do not fence the garden on all sides with beads).

__label__objective LukÅ¡iÄ does not expect JanÅ¡a and JankoviÄ to take "radical measures" <p/> Ljubljana, 08 January (STA) - SD President Igor LukÅ¡iÄ believes that the findings of the anti-corruption commission regarding their assets should make Prime Minister and SDS President Janez JanÅ¡a and PS President Zoran JankoviÄ think twice and then do "what the majority expects".LukÅ¡iÄ also believes that the SD President and SDS President Janez JanÅ¡a and the PS President Zoran JankoviÄ should rethink the matter. But he said it was difficult to expect them to decide on "any radical measures". <p/> It is very bad for Slovenia that we have two people at the top of Slovenian politics who ignore the practice we want to introduce in the country, i.e. that politicians have transparent finances, that they are able to explain where their income comes from, and if they are not able to do so, that they leave their posts, LukÅ¡iÄ said in response to the findings of the anti-corruption commission. <p/> He hopes that "this is the drop over the edge that will finally mean the introduction of a new practice in Slovenian politics". Asked specifically whether JanÅ¡a and JankoviÄ should resign, he said that the right thing to do would be "to think the matter through and then do what the majority expects". <p/> However, he does not want to talk about the options that would follow a possible resignation - whether he himself would opt for a technical government or for early elections. First, he says, they both have to make the right move, and only then will there be time to think about the way forward. <p/> He adds that "there is no point in getting ahead of ourselves, because unfortunately experience shows that in such situations, people in Slovenia have so far, as a rule, not decided to do what they should have done". <p/> What is important for Slovenia, he says, is to get a government that is credible. LukÅ¡iÄ points out that the government has 18% support and that this is a key problem. He also problematises the fact that a government with 18% support is going to sell Slovenian assets. "We simply know that this will not be done credibly, it cannot be," he concludes. <p/> " If these deals are run by people who cannot explain how 200 000 came into their account, how will they be able to explain where these huge billions will go. 12 billion are at stake," the SD leader added. <p/> The Anti-Corruption Commission found that SDS President Janez JanÅ¡a and Positivna Slovenije President Zoran JankoviÄ had violated anti-corruption legislation when auditing the assets of party presidents. According to the Commission, JankoviÄ failed to declare assets worth at least â¬2.4 million, and part of the financial inflows into his personal bank account came from a chain of transactions that started in Grep. As for JanÅ¡a, he notes that his assets have inexplicably increased by â¬210,000.

The lawyer is under investigation for alleged abuse of position and money laundering in the notorious Delamaris case, in which he allegedly received â¬1.3 million from Vegrad, reports today's Dnevnik daily. <p/> "In this respect, we can only stress that Mr Miro Senica is convinced that all the suspicions against him are groundless and unfounded, which will undoubtedly be revealed when the investigation is completed," the law firm of Mr Senica told siol.net. <p/> Senica spent money on a villa in PortoroÅ¾ <p/> The controversial deal allegedly took place in 2007. Vegrad from Velenje bought the Delamaris fish processing plant in Isola for â¬22 million. The land was to be used for the Urban Renewal Izola project. Vegrad paid a commission of 1.35 million. This ended up in the account of BuÅ¾ekijan, a company led by Blanka Muster, one of Senica's colleagues. In reality, the money ended up with Senica, who used it to buy a villa in PortoroÅ¾. This is now owned by his daughter, Marusa Senica. <p/> In addition to Senica, the investigating judge will also question the former First Lady of Vegrad, Hilda TovÅ¡ak, the lawyer's daughter, Marusa Senica, as well as his colleagues Blanka Muster and Olga ZavirÅ¡ek.

I'm thinking from a purely consumerist point of view, post festum of course, because like most of you I wasn't born yet. But with all these revivals and golden memories, I have utopically recalled that time when mass consumption went the other way. <p/> This time the Magdalene is a green square box, clumsily and naively designed for today, but interesting precisely because of this immediacy. The round title has mythological proportions and the black and white symbolic photograph shows nothing of sentimentality but the triumph of technology. However, since the scripture is not intended for design dogmas, I will abbreviate. Titania is the name of the product and it is a handmade macchino per pasta. <p/> My grandmother gave me this metal beast because she knows I like to cook. The seller's internal stamp shows that it was bought on 9 May 1968 in the shop 'La Casalinga' in Gorizia. Although I have never seen either my grandmother or my mother make pasta themselves - with or without a pasta maker - I have made one quite solid pasta from the first one. <p/> The process goes like this. First, the home-made dough is pushed through two rotating rollers, which roll the dough evenly into strips. Repeat the process, if necessary, with a narrower gap between the two rollers, depending on the type of pasta you want. Then pass the strips through the second spout, turn the crank and watch with glowing hearts the culinary miracle - noodles coming out the other side. Ugh, haute cuisine. <p/> Pasta is not exactly Slovenia's national dish and it arrived on the shelves relatively late. As I have gleaned from the web, the Mlinotest pasta factory was built in the late 1950s (proudly made since 1958). Housewives were stretching and drying simple noodles in their backyards long before that, since a product made of flour, eggs and water is a generic phenomenon rather than the alchemist's secret of a lodge of freebooters. <p/> If there is one product from our culinary treasure chest that is anti-potentine, it is the miller. They are made from rolled-out dough that has been baked in a whole piece in a bread oven, usually after baking bread. The baked dough was broken into larger pieces, soaked in water and thickened with whatever gravel was on hand. <p/> Since we don't usually have bread ovens at home, we can fascinate our invited guests with home-made pasta and hum a light Italian canzone as we turn the crank. Or spin a bouquet of evergreen Slovenian songs. Remember, we're in the sixties.

__label__subjective Slovenia: Public appeal by the Higher Education Trade Union of Slovenia <p/> Ljubljana, 16 June 2012 (MOREL) - The Higher Education Trade Union of Slovenia has addressed a public appeal to the government, the National Assembly, university rectors and faculty deans, and the National Agency for Quality in Higher Education, which we are publishing here in full: The results of the negotiations with the trade unions are very painful for public higher education. Because higher education is financed differently from secondary and primary education and because this financing has been carried out in an unconstitutional way for several years, universities have been left out of the negotiations. Not only has the state failed to adopt the law on the financing of state universities and colleges, which is required by the Constitution in its Article 58. It has crowned the unconstitutionality of the previous practice of funding by regulation by deciding the level of funding for higher education politically and arbitrarily, by rebalancing the budget. The State promises students free studies, while at the same time announcing tuition fees in the National Reform Programme. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly obvious that it is trying to artificially lower the quality of studies by putting financial pressure on public universities, thereby triggering the rampant privatisation of higher education. Universities have already had insufficient funds to carry out five years of study, and the new funding will be barely sufficient for the first level. In view of the financial constraints, the three public universities are already preparing to lay off fee-earners and temporary staff, to retire without replacements, and there are various ideas of radically reducing the rights deriving from titles, grades and employment contracts. These ideas culminate in unlawful proposals on unpaid additional teaching work, on supplementing full-time and additional teaching work with low-paid honorary work, and the demand that university teachers themselves provide universities with funds for the research part of their salary, which is already contractually due to them. This is roughly equivalent to requiring judges to generate part of their salary themselves on the market by securing a reasonable number of disputes in which to dispense justice. The non-recognition of research work and the expansion of self-financing part-time study could begin the uncontrolled disintegration of higher education as a public service. The work of higher education teachers and staff has always included both teaching and research. For a full-time or part-time employee, only the direct teaching commitment is defined; the remaining hours up to the full-time commitment comprise the indirect teaching commitment (preparation, examinations, tutoring, etc.), research (as demonstrated by meeting the habilitation criteria) and management work (membership of committees, etc.). The point of the legal regulation limiting the direct teaching obligation is that university teachers and staff are obliged to devote their regular working time to research, the results of which they must prove at the time of their election: every university teacher, with the exception of a minority of full professors, must be habilitated (elected to a title) every five years, and must meet demanding criteria for scientific work. Since habilitation resulting from research is a condition for maintaining employment, it is legally untenable for universities to make this same employment conditional on the independent acquisition of external research funding. The task of a university is not to reproduce existing knowledge, but to create and disseminate new knowledge. Therefore, basic research in universities must have stable sources of funding. The provision of these resources is to be laid down by law, in accordance with Article 58 of the Constitution. The Public Finance Balancing Act has allowed universities to modify their programmes autonomously. At first sight, it would appear that the State has thus given universities greater autonomy. In reality, however, it has given their managements all the power to rearrange, cut, merge and abolish study programmes at will. We would like to point out that such measures threaten not only employment, but also the quality of accredited programmes, the right of students to study in the programme in which they have enrolled and to pursue appropriate studies at a second level. We therefore call on the National Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for Quality in Higher Education to problematise the reaccreditation of programmes if they are altered beyond recognition due to financial pressures or if they are implemented in a way that is not of the highest quality. Universities have insufficient human resources to carry out their studies, and at the same time the state, by withholding funds, is artificially creating a situation where there are suddenly too many staff. As this is a public service carried out in the interest of all the citizens of the Republic of Slovenia, we will initiate the appropriate legal procedures in relation to the undermining of the rights of public employees in universities. We would also like to point out that the rights of students are also at stake. If, under the financial conditions of the rebalancing, an agreement between the Ministry and the student organisation was possible, it is an agreement to destroy public higher education, the aim of which is rampant privatisation. The Ministry's promises that there will be no tuition fees are unconvincing hypocrisy, and the agreement with the official student organisation on free full-time study opens the door wide to the restriction of full-time study and the expansion of self-financing part-time study. The quality of studies will fall. Since the conditions for accreditation by the National Agency for Quality are low, opportunities will open up for private operators, who will be granted concessions by the state on the basis of easily obtained accreditation, according to the interests of individuals and political-economic clienteles. We propose that the National Agency for Quality tighten the conditions for institutional accreditation and demand an impact on the level of concessionary funding granted to HEIs. Above all, it is self-evident to require full funding for programmes already accredited, which are delivered as a public service and which have also been accredited on the basis of cost and staffing needs assessments. This includes professional, administrative and technical staff, who were already on low pay grades and have fallen even lower as a result of austerity measures. These categories of workers have hitherto enjoyed the basic rights that come with civil servant status, rights that may no longer be taken for granted in the forthcoming reorganisations. The State is deliberately depleting public higher education. In the words of the Minister, "the government is forcing rectors to behave as any crisis manager would behave". This statement is obscene and shows a complete lack of responsibility for a key area of development, as well as a lack of understanding of the social mission of universities and the constitutional role of higher education in the Republic of Slovenia. Recall that the autonomy of universities (Article 58 of the Constitution) is also to be interpreted by the Constitutional Court in the light of Article 59 of the Constitution, i.e. "primarily as the autonomy of professors to research and teach autonomously (independently), without restrictions and pressures" (U-I-34/94). Furthermore, as public servants, employees of higher education institutions perform a public service for the population of the Republic of Slovenia. Unfortunately, the government instead advocates a market-based approach, with an emphasis on corporate governance, consumerism and the pursuit of short-term profit. In this situation, we wonder whether universities will be able to fulfil their role? Will it be possible, in the face of financial cutbacks, to maintain the universal accessibility of education and the level of quality expected by students and employers? How is it possible that universities are playing an increasingly marginal role in the coming 'knowledge society'? The disintegration of higher education as a public service will not only affect the teaching and professional staff employed in universities. Profit-oriented higher education will inevitably widen the social divide between an elite minority who will be able to provide their children with a quality education, and thus with social status and security, and the vast majority of the rest of the population, who will either not be able to afford higher education or will be forced into long-term debt All this gives the unpleasant impression that university and college leaders have been too quick to bow their heads and accept political pressures. We know that crisis management is nothing more than the informal transformation of the university into a business that will serve neither the staff, nor the students, nor the economic and other development of the community, but the interests of local cliques. We therefore call on rectors and deans to firmly reject the destructive role assigned to them by politics and to open a broad public debate on the participation of workers and students in the governance of public universities. We remind university and faculty leaders that employees will not accept a situation in which external financial pressures become an excuse to promote political and private interests within the institutions themselves. We inform the government and the management of universities and faculties that, in a situation dictated by rebel budgets, we may be forced to suspend the study process already this calendar year. We call on students to support us in our efforts to achieve free and quality public higher education," said the appeal signed by Marko MarinÄiÄ. (end)

Our sales consultants will be happy to advise you and help you choose the right promotional gift for your customers. <p/> Promotional products are still a great way to attract new customers. In an era where modern technology is reducing the impact of many forms of media advertising, promotional products are becoming increasingly important for reaching new customers. <p/> Why promotional products are still effective Retailers are increasingly using promotional products to attract new customers because of their usefulness. Television, as an advertising medium, is increasingly under threat with the rise of new TV channels, and it is easy for viewers to skip adverts. In the case of a promotional product, the advertisement cannot be skipped, as it is part of the product and is visible whenever the product is used. <p/> Promotional product manufacturing on the rise Today, promotional product manufacturing is booming because it offers advertisers what many other advertising methods do not, i.e. your message is guaranteed to reach the desired population. Despite the many messages we bombard our potential customers with, advertising with promotional products is effective because many of the messages are internalised. For a message to be internalised by customers, it needs to be repeated many times. A promotional product with its own message is the ideal way to achieve this. <p/> Targeting and measurability Internet advertising makes it easy to reach your target audience and monitor the impact of your advertising campaign. We can do the same with the right promotional product. For example, we print a unique promotional code on the promotional product, which then helps us calculate how much we have recouped our investment. <p/> Promotional products as part of your promotional plan Promotional products will continue to be just one part of your marketing plan, but they play a very important role and should not be overlooked. Promotional products are a great way to make a service tangible and achieve brand awareness through constant messaging. <p/> UK - A 2011 survey by The British Promotional Merchandise Association (BPMA) showed that marketers much prefer to buy practical promotional products that have been proven to be good and effective in the past. These Top 3 products include pens, notepads and post-it notes, and canvas shopping bags or ECO bags. <p/> When asked how they get the promotional products they want, almost 70 respondents said that the supplier they currently work with is a key source of information. <p/> Despite the fact that more and more money is being spent on marketing, more and more companies want newer and more original ways of promotion to differentiate themselves from the rest.

__label__subjective Challenge: Due to the high frequency of visitors, it was necessary to take into account the different cultural habits of people when using the toilet facilities. They used conventional hygienic toilet paper, which often caused clogging of the drains. Emptying the septic tank was an additional cost and resulted in unpleasant odours. <p/> Needs and solution: They needed something that would allow them to: - eliminate the clogging of drains, - reduce the cleaning intervals of septic tanks, - eliminate odours in toilets, - reduce the costs associated with this, - be more environmentally friendly. We have made this possible with Bio Active toilet paper, which is based on BATP technology.<p/> Result: HIGH SEWAGE DISCLOSURE, RESULTING IN: <p/> - reduction of drain blockages by more than 50, - reduction of costs for faeces disposal and drain cleaning by more than 50, - elimination of odours (especially when the weather changes) - increased care and environmental friendliness. <p/> We have got suitable paper for a larger number of visitors. The paper is rapidly degradable. All in all, it is cheaper. Bernard PETROVÄIÄ
__label__objective Strong outburst in the sun ! <p/> The activity of the Sun is of growing importance to humanity as we are increasingly dependent on global connections, the vast majority of which are via satellites. The Earth is shielded from the flow of material from the Sun by a magnetic field. <p/> However, in the event of a major flare, some particles will slip through and hit the Earth's atmosphere, which can affect surface infrastructure during so-called geomagnetic storms. The Earth is shielded from the flow of material from the Sun by its magnetic field. However, in stronger eruptions, some particles slip through and hit the Earth's atmosphere. What is the risk of this happening ? <p/> (Dr PrimoÅ¾ KajdiÄ -)These outbursts, and if the conditions are right, then some of these particles may indeed enter the Earth's ionosphere or atmosphere, especially near the north and south magnetic poles. Then these particles, because they have very high energy, cause radiation and we then see this as the aurora borealis. The second thing that happens is that the Earth's magnetic field changes dramatically and this is then called a geomagnetic storm. But in general, changes in the Earth's magnetic field due to external solar winds and other phenomena, what we call space weather, are also felt on Earth. They can cause damage to our electrical wiring, our satellites can also burn up, stop working, astronauts' lives could be in danger, and so on. Such phenomena have occurred in the past. Then, with every solar cycle, we move more and more into space, more and more dependent on the technology that is in space. In the future, it will be very important to study these phenomena on the Sun and in the solar wind, because we will be more and more sensitive to them. We will need to find out how we can protect ourselves against them in order to minimise the damage. <p/> One more thing about the Sun itself. <p/> The Sun contains 99.8% of the mass of the Solar System. The rest of the mass is mostly found in Jupiter, with only a small fraction shared by all the other celestial bodies in the Solar System. The Sun is a perfectly average G2 star. In size, it is one of the 10% largest stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which is made up of around 100 billion stars. The average size of stars in the Milky Way is less than 50% of the size of the Sun. <p/> The present Sun is made up of 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and the rest is all other chemical elements. The Sun is slowly converting hydrogen into helium. This releases various waves which are detected on Earth as heat, light and various radiations. The Sun rotates on its axis. But because it is a big gaseous ball, its parts rotate at different speeds. It makes one revolution every 25.4 days at the equator and one every 36 days at the poles. It has a core in the centre that is 25% of its total diameter. The core rotates uniformly and behaves like a solid body. The surface of the core is under hellish conditions. The core has a surface temperature of 15.6 million Kelvin and a pressure of 250 billion atmospheres. The fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium nuclei produces a huge energy of 386 billion billion kilowatts every second. Thus, every second, 700 million tonnes of hydrogen are transformed into 695 million tonnes of helium. 5 million tonnes per second are gamma rays penetrating through the solar mantle to the photosphere. The photosphere is the surface of the Sun that we can see. As it travels through the sun's mantle, the strength of the radiation is reduced as it returns to the core. Some of the radiation just reaches the edge of the photosphere and flies off the Sun as visible light and thermal radiation. The temperature of the photosphere is 5800 degrees Kelvin. Sometimes we see darker sunspots on the surface, these have a temperature of 3800 degrees Kelvin. Sunspots are formed by the influence of the Sun's magnetic field. However, the way they are formed has not yet been satisfactorily explained. Above the photosphere, there is a thin chromosphere. Above this is the extremely thin corona. This extends millions of kilometres into space. It is visible at solar eclipse as a brilliant ring. The temperatures of the gases in it can reach up to a million degrees Kelvin. <p/> The Sun's magnetic field is extremely strong and extends far beyond Pluto. At the edge of this field is thought to lie the Oort Cloud of icy celestial bodies, the outermost edge of our Solar System. As well as heat and light, the Sun also emits a faint stream of electrified particles. These are mainly electrons and protons. These are called the solar wind. The Sun radiates them at a steady 450 km/second. Only when there are large outbursts, visible as giant flares or protuberances, does the intensity of the solar wind increase. Sunspots and prominences occur on a fairly regular 11-year cycle. But the solar wind affects the paths of artificial satellites, pushing them further and further off course. It pushes lighter particles out of icy celestial bodies, comets, and forms their tails. In larger outbursts, solar wind particles also hit the Earth's magnetic field. This brings it closer to the surface and the solar wind particles hit particles in the Earth's atmosphere. This creates the coloured aurora borealis, or northern lights. The particles are also dangerous to humans and astronauts must wear protective clothing. In the event of a major outbreak, they must take refuge in specially protected areas of the space station. It would be possible to build a spaceship with a sail that uses the steady pressure of the solar wind for propulsion. <p/> The Sun is 4.5 billion years old, the same age as our Solar System. Since its formation, it has consumed about 50% of the hydrogen. So they predict it will shine as brightly as ever for another 5 billion years. At the end of its lifetime, it will have expanded by half its present size. When it has used up all its hydrogen, it will radically change and swallow all its planets into itself.
__label__objective An applicant for a review of a public tender does not, under the Act on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures, per se acquire the status of a party to an administrative dispute in which the administrative decision awarding the concession is challenged, which concludes a tendering procedure in which he did not participate. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> The appeal is dismissed and the decision of the Administrative Court of the Republic of Slovenia in Ljubljana, No U 2088/2001-9 of 30 January 2002 is confirmed. <p/> Reasoning <p/> By the contested order, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action against the defendant's decision of 22.11.2001 under point 1 of the operative part of the order and dismissed the application for interim measures of 23.11.2001 under point 2 of the operative part of the order.By that decision granting a concession for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services, it was decided to grant the concession to M. d.d. for a period of 15 years, with the possibility of renewal, V., L. It was also decided that the concession shall include the right to use the frequency bands, to install the relevant public telecommunications network, to interconnect the network and that the concessionaire shall be obliged to ensure the operation of its network in accordance with the Regulation on the granting of concessions, with other regulations and with the concession contract, to pay a one-off non-refundable concession fee of 22 billion Slovenian tolls and to pay an annual fee for the use of the allocated part of the radio spectrum. The defendant published a public tender for the award of up to three concessions for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services on the territory of the Republic of Slovenia in the frequency bands 1900 MHz-1980 MHz, 2010 MHz-2025 MHz and 2110 MHz-2170 MHz in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No 19/01 of 16.3.2001. The first call for tenders was unsuccessful because only one tender was received, and a new call for tenders for the award of the concession was published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No 46/01 of 8.6.2001. At the time of the opening of the tenders, the expert committee noted that five potential tenderers had submitted tender documents on the basis of the call for tenders, and that two tenders had been received within the time limit for submission of the tenders within the time limit for submission of tenders. One bid did not contain all the elements required in the tender documents and was therefore not considered. On 3.9.2001, the applicant submitted a request for review of the concession award procedure to the National Audit Office. By decision of 8.11.2001, the latter rejected the request for review. The concession award procedure, which had been suspended as a result of the submitted review, was continued. The expert committee, which drew up its report of 19.11.2001, found that the tender submitted by M.d.d. met the conditions of the tender documents. In the grounds of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance stated in paragraph 1 of the operative part of the judgment that it had taken its decision to reject the application on the basis of the preliminary examination of the application under Article 34(1)(4) of the Administrative Disputes Act (CLA). A claimant in an administrative dispute can only be a person who has the status of an active party in the administrative proceedings, a person who has the status of a passive party and a person who has participated in the administrative proceedings as an intervener in order to protect his rights or legal interests. In the procedure for the award of the concession, in addition to the successful concessionaire, parties to the procedure may be those tenderers whose bids were not accepted. The tenders for the concession were submitted by M.d.d. and D.d.o.o. within the tendering period, but the applicant did not participate in the tender. In an administrative dispute challenging a decision taken in an administrative procedure in which the applicant was neither a party nor an intervener, the applicant does not have standing, since the contested decision clearly did not infringe its rights or direct interests based on the law. The applicant has not established the right or the legal interest to assert the claim alleged in the application and its active standing, which is a procedural prerequisite for bringing an administrative action, is not established. The applicant's request for a review of the procedure for the award of the concession for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services was rejected by decision of the State Audit Commission of 8.11.2001. Article 23(2) of the Act on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 78/99 and No 90/99) provides that there is no ordinary or extraordinary remedy against the decisions of the State Audit Board, but that an action may be brought before a competent court to seek damages from the contracting authority. Objections relating to the award procedure which have already been decided by the National Audit Office do not constitute legally relevant objections in the review procedure of the concession award decision. In the explanatory memorandum to 2. point 2 of the operative part of the judgment, the Court of First Instance stated that the applicant had not established that the decision challenged in the action infringed its rights or its direct interests based on the law, which is a procedural prerequisite for a decision on an application for an interim injunction under Article 69 of the Civil Procedure Code. This follows from the reasons set out in recital 1 of the operative part of the judgment, since the applicant has failed to establish its standing to bring the action. The Court of First Instance therefore dismissed the application for interim measures pursuant to Article 69(2) of the Civil Code. <p/> The applicant appeals on all three grounds set out in Article 72 of the Civil Procedure Code. The appellant claims that the Court of Appeal should set aside both points of the contested order and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a fresh decision. The applicant claims that it has standing to bring the action and the application for interim measures in the present proceedings. The Court of First Instance bases its position solely on the fact that the applicant did not submit a tender in response to the invitation to tender and thus did not participate directly as an active party or as a passive party or intervener. Such reasoning effectively limits the potential claimants in an administrative dispute exclusively to direct and formal parties to the procedure prior to the adoption of the administrative act, for which there is no legal basis in Article 18 of the CPL. The circle of potential claimants in an administrative dispute is much wider under that provision. Anyone who believes that an administrative act infringes a right or a direct benefit of his or her based on the law may be a claimant. The theory also recognises the active standing of a party who has not even formally participated in the administrative procedure, provided that he can, of course, establish or prove his legal interest. In a tendering procedure, the legal status of intervener within the meaning of Article 43 of the General Administrative Procedure Act cannot exist. It was only possible to participate in the tendering procedure as a tenderer or as an applicant for review under the Act on Review of Public Procurement Procedures. In the review procedure, the applicant was granted the status of a party and active standing. It is reasonable to assume that, taking into account the specificities of the tender procedure, the applicant was indeed a party to the tender procedure as an applicant for review and was granted such status by the defendant and the National Audit Office. It therefore considers that it had already demonstrated its legal interest in participating in the tendering procedure in the procedure preceding the defendant's decision by submitting a request for review, since it did not submit a tender on the ground that the tendering procedure was unlawful. It can therefore legitimately claim that the contested decision of the defendant, as an administrative act adopted in the context of a tendering procedure, infringes its rights and directly benefits. In fact, as a result of the illegality of the invitation to tender, the applicant lost the possibility of obtaining the concession which was the subject of the invitation to tender and which was finally awarded to M. by the contested administrative decision, as an act adopted in a procedure which the applicant claims to have been unlawful. It is untenable to hold that it has active standing to bring an application for review in the same proceedings in which, following the conclusion of those proceedings and the adoption of the administrative act, it does not have active standing to bring the action. Apart from the finding that the applicant did not submit its bid in the tendering procedure and the erroneous assertion that it did not assert or protect its rights in the concession award procedure, that is to say, in the tendering procedure, the Court of First Instance does not give any other substantive reasoning in the contested order. It did not serve the application and the application for interim measures on the defendant for a response. Nor did it hold the main hearing which had been requested in order to further substantiate the allegations by examining witnesses. It did not even state reasons for its decision, since it did not state the reasons on the decisive facts, which constitutes an absolute fundamental infringement of the procedural provisions within the meaning of Article 72(3) of the Civil Procedure Code. By failing to hold a main hearing, the Court of First Instance substantially infringed the procedural provisions within the meaning of Article 72(4) of the Civil Procedure Code. In addition, it erred and failed to fully establish the factual situation as regards the applicant's legal status and activities in the tendering procedure itself and its rights and direct benefits, and, as a consequence, it erred in substantive law in holding that the applicant did not have active legal standing to bring the action in the present proceedings. The applicant also has standing to bring an application for interim measures and, in accordance with the provisions of the CPL, fully maintains its application for interim measures in the present case. <p/> In its response to the appeal, the defendant submits that the applicant cannot be a party to these proceedings as it lacks standing. The applicant did not submit a bid for the concession either in the first or in the re-tender. The fact that the applicant has already provided mobile telecommunications services does not automatically confer a legal interest in bringing the present action. Since it did not participate in the concession award procedure by submitting any tender, the concession award decision did not decide on its rights. The administrative measure therefore does not affect her rights or a legitimate interest. The possibility of exercising the right to obtain the concession ended with the expiry of the time-limit for submitting a complete tender for the invitation to tender. The fact that the applicant has been granted a legal interest in the review procedure before the National Audit Office does not automatically confer a legal interest in the administrative proceedings. In the proceedings before the National Audit Commission, the status of a party is determined by Article 9 of the Law on the review of public procurement procedures, whereas in the proceedings before the Administrative Court, it is determined by Article 18 of the CPL. Each law defines the active legal capacity of the parties in a different way. The Law on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures provides for a wider range of beneficiaries who may initiate a review procedure on the ground that an independent body is reviewing the legality of the public tender itself. Given that the party has been granted the status of party to the proceedings there, the competent authority has already assessed the legality of the call for tenders and rejected the request for review. The defendant submits, first of all, that the whole tendering procedure is unlawful and that it was therefore not possible for it to participate in the procedure. In the proceedings before the Administrative Court, however, the circle of persons with standing is narrower. It is for the competent court to determine whether the appellant's request to intervene is justified. Such a procedure prevents the chicanery of intervention by those who cannot show any prejudice and who would only make the proceedings more difficult for an active or passive party. The appellant therefore requests the Court of Appeal to dismiss the appeal as unfounded. <p/> The appeal is not well founded. <p/> In the Court of Appeal's view, the Court of First Instance was correct to dismiss the applicant's action on the basis of paragraph 34(1)(4) of Article 34(1) of the EC Treaty. <p/> of Article 34 of the CPL. The applicant's plea that it has active standing to bring an action in an administrative dispute is unfounded, since it relies on its indirect participation in the tendering procedure by virtue of the fact that it was the applicant in an application for review of a procurement procedure to which it was granted the status of a party. According to Article 18(1) of the CPL, a claimant may be an individual, a legal person, an organisation, a locality, a group of persons and others who consider that a right or a direct benefit of theirs based on a law has been infringed by an administrative act. However, according to the provision of Article 9 of the Act on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures (Official Gazette of the RS, No 78/99), a request for review may be lodged by any person who has or had an interest in the award of a contract and who has suffered or may suffer damage as a result of the conduct of the contracting authority, which is alleged in the request for review as a misconduct of the contracting authority in the procedure for awarding the public contract. The Law on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures is a specific regulation governing the legal protection of tenderers in public procurement procedures, which is implemented by reviewing the public procurement procedures defined in the Public Procurement Law, the bodies competent for the protection of the rights of tenderers and the procedure governing the work of the bodies under this Law. However, there is no ordinary or extraordinary legal remedy against a decision of the State Audit Board, only an action before a competent court of law to seek damages from the contracting authority. Given the purpose and object of this law, the active standing in a review procedure is substantively different from that in an administrative dispute. Any person who has or had an interest in the award of a contract and any person who has suffered or may suffer damage as a result of the conduct of the contracting authority may bring an action for review. For this reason, a party to a review of public procurement procedures does not per se acquire the status of a party to administrative litigation proceedings when the decision to award a concession is challenged. The decision to award a concession puts an end to the tendering procedure, and an action against such a decision may only be brought by persons fulfilling the conditions laid down in Article 18(1) of the CPL. In the present case, the request for review of the concession award procedure was examined by the National Audit Commission and the specific request of the defendant was rejected. The subject-matter of the administrative dispute cannot therefore be a repetition of the identical claim, which is in fact the applicant's claim. In an administrative procedure, the applicant could only assert a right or a direct benefit based on a right which would be infringed by the decision to grant the concession. The grant of the concession is not a right of the defendant. The defendant's only right in a tendering procedure for the award of a concession is to submit its tender to the contracting authority within the time-limit, on the same terms as the other participants. Neither the Telecommunications Act nor the Regulation on the granting of concessions for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services gives rise to a direct benefit to the applicant based on the Act. It is apparent from the appellant's submissions that the defendant is only claiming an interest in fact in obtaining the concession, and is not demonstrating a legal interest by challenging the concession decision. In the present case, since there is neither a right nor a direct interest of the defendant based on the law which is infringed by the contested administrative measure, the Court of Appeal considers that the Court of First Instance was correct in its decision that the applicant had not established its active standing in the present administrative proceedings. <p/> The Court of First Instance dismissed the action at the preliminary examination stage on the basis of Article 34(1)(4) of the CPL. At that stage of the proceedings, the Court of First Instance ruled exclusively on the applicant's standing, and therefore did not infringe the provision on the main hearing procedure (Article 72(4) of the Civil Procedure Code), since it did not rule on the substance or examine the substance of the contested measure. Nor did it serve copies of the application for interim measures and the application for interim measures with annexes on the defendant at that stage of the proceedings. It does so only after it has not dismissed the action under Article 34 of the Civil Procedure Code or annulled the contested measure under Article 35(1) of the Civil Procedure Code or declared it void under Article 35(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. The Court of First Instance also did not infringe the provision on the procedure in an administrative dispute (Article 72(3) of the CPL), since it based and explained its decision on the distinction between tendering, review and public procurement procedures and an administrative dispute (pages 3 and 4 of the judgment). <p/> The pleas in law alleging erroneous and incomplete findings of fact and incorrect application of the substantive law, however, relate only to the applicant's active standing. <The appellant's plea in law alleging that the application for interim measures was dismissed is also unfounded. The applicant does not have standing to bring an application for interim measures if it does not have standing to bring an action in administrative proceedings and, moreover, does not state on what grounds that that part of the order is unlawful. <p/> The Court of Appeal held that the grounds on which the applicant challenges the order of the Court of First Instance are not established. Nor are the grounds on which the Court of First Instance is required to act of its own motion. It therefore dismissed the appeal as unfounded on the basis of Article 73 in conjunction with Article 68 of the CLA and upheld the order of the Court of First Instance.
__label__subjective Hamilton does not want a duel with Rosberg <p/> Lewis Hamilton will do everything he can to avoid an internal showdown with Nico Rosberg later in the season, such as the one we saw at the end of the Bahrain VN race. <p/> "Nico will be fast in every race," said Hamilton ahead of the start of the race weekend in Barcelona, where the first European round of the season will take place. " In China I was determined that we would not be as close as in Bahrain. It was more like a race in Malaysia. I will continue to work with the same approach as before, because it is working perfectly," added the Briton, who has won the last three races of the F1 championship. <p/> Hamilton has proved himself as Mercedes' " number one " driver at the last three rounds, but the former world champion points out that Rosberg is far from beaten. " He's still leading the championship, isn't he? Sport is a psychological game. You can't measure the effect that good results have on other people, but I know they have a positive effect on me," said the Briton. <p/> Mercedes has shown a significant advantage over its biggest rivals in the first four races, but Hamilton is confident that Rosberg is not the only challenger for the world title. "There are still a lot of races to go and we can't predict what will happen. Ferrari has taken a big step forward in China. They are not as fast as us, but the jump from tenth to third is very impressive. Renuault will also improve its engines. We must not fall asleep. We have to keep improving and I'm sure we will," Hamilton concluded. <p/> Lauda: Mercedes more impressive than Red Bull <p/> Niki Lauda believes that Mercedes' dominance in the opening stages of the 2014 season is more impressive than the dominance shown by Red Bull at the end of last season. "This year we have new engines, gearboxes and brakes. Mercedes cars have reached the finish line in the first four races, which is a remarkable result for me. If you have bad engines like last year, it is not difficult to finish nine races in a row like Vettel did," said the Mercedes non-executive director, who did not expect the silver medallists to be in such a good position after four races. " For me, the most important thing is that we are reliable. Everything has clicked for us. Others have done it in the past, but never in the first season with completely new rules," concluded Lauda. <p/> Source: Autosport.com <p/> This year we have new engines, gearboxes and brakes.

__label__subjective Proposal for a Spatial Development Strategy (SPR) for the Municipality of Radovljica <p/> J.U.: On the margins of the public debate held on Wednesday, 10 January 2007 from 6 to 8 p.m. <p/> All municipalities in Slovenia are in the middle of a planning process. By July 2007, they should have brought their respective spatial planning acts, which are extremely complex in terms of procedure, into line with the new legislation. Since only a few municipalities are further along than ours (we are in the middle of the beginning), is it to be expected that either the deadline will be extended, or the government will just manage to do as much as it can, and finally, for once, reward those who can do it by the deadline, and the rest ...? <p/> Undoubtedly, these processes are and will be the first serious planning in more than 20 years, in other words: it is an extremely challenging undertaking for the administration, the general and interested public and the planning profession. Since 1980 (self-management), we have been "tinkering" with the spatial and environmental planning system on the basis of the non-market economy, which - surprisingly - has been quite good in some parts. <p/> As far as our municipality is concerned: need it be pointed out that the administration's management has approached the matter left-handed in terms of substance and procedure? It simply does not have the expertise in cases of major dilemmas! <p/> Yes, that's the way it is when bureaucrats ignore the rajas! All the indications are that this planning will receive the same treatment as the dog excrement ordinance, which is of course not news in Radovljica. Last night, the Director, in a low-key rhetoric, respectfully stressed the importance of the process and the document, but only actions count. <p/> Let us stress: <p/> everything in the municipality revolves around space. Other departments are also important, but not as fatal as encroachments. The only complete department of the municipal administration, staffed by professional, educated and administratively proficient employees, looks as if they have been successfully weaned off professionalism and accustomed to subservience to politicians, like the MOL, "when everyone is busting their ass". This is due to a misguided governmental logic (we are in charge now, if something is not right, we will show that this is the only possible and even the only right thing to do, that is why we have PR) and a touch of servility, only the first silence and eaten professionalism will suffice... <p/> The materials under discussion do not testify to the care of a good steward for the emerging creature, in fact, it could even be argued that something (the ALCs) was explicitly not allowed to be included in it. <p/> Even the operational meetings of the administration with the spatial planning authorities (e.g. KS, sectoral, e.g. agriculture, housing, etc.) could have yielded more if they had been properly conceived and committed to. To be clear: the administration is the planning authority, and the documents are drawn up together with a specially paid team. And if something is left out or selectively drafted, we - with their superficial "reading" of our space - are the ones in trouble. If such a document is commissioned and its content dictated by politics, then we are far from a profession (Al Gore, An Inconvenient Truth ... ), nothing changes (except for the worse). <p/> What is also missing are proposals from those responsible officials (aren't we making too many synecdoches? ! ) who, in their official capacity, are the first to be responsible for making proposals (obligations of laws, decrees, contracts: local infrastructure, culture, education, etc.). <p/> The situation does not show the slightest concern for the mayor (excused absence abroad, where are the two vice-mayors? ) or for the director of the administration, who should have a project manager, and above all, be trusted to do so. The process thus has no profiled promoter ('municipality', mayor, director, head of department, chairman of the spatial planning committee? ! ) and does not even receive the necessary publicity. If you sell, advertise! There is no campaign, logo or sign that something fatal is in the pipeline to involve as many people as possible in the processes, and consequently a greater involvement of the disciplines. The time around the New Year is, of course, not the right time for unveilings. The administration is merely covering legal formalities, not the substantive reasons for extending the festive blackout. <p/> What stands out from such superficial processes is the "redundancy" of planning in the light of the parallel ad hoc actions promoted (elections), and the "pro forma" content of the "development coalition", the voting machine of the only good thinker who will lead us to paradise anyway, is a little annoying in the new mandate. <p/> Not to mention the occasional carping about the adopted and approved development platforms 2007 - 2013 (we are going to the region for EU money ... ), which are not yet recognised as typical political documents for daily use. <p/> We can be quite calmly critical, because the product under discussion (the decree) speaks of the politicisation of purely professional tasks. The formal inclusion of the CFs (do we have them for that?) and the exclusion of the 11 "development opposition" councillors of the municipal council is living proof of paper democracy, or of the scenario of how "Janko" (who is the "broomstick" here? ) imagines a wonderland where we will all be living like in paradise.... <p/> Everything points to the fact that the understanding of the preparation of the emerging document is reduced to an administrative minimum, everything that exists today without propaganda, if it really is not indispensable, practically does not exist. <p/> (J.U.: more information on the contents will be presented periodically, the public debate is open until 15 January 2007, more information on the decree and the background is on the CoR website). <p/> The public debate, the proceedings and the controversial contents are reported by the main municipal media (website) amongst "other things" with only a cursory information on the hearing, the documents are attached. That this is not enough is shown by all the poorly attended hearings, but nothing by the administration! <p/> We will wait with interest to see what the Provincial News has to say about the procedures and processes. It is not worth pointing out that the administration has not taken care - apart from the filming, to which we have been warned a couple of times by the Director of the administration - of the "public relations" which otherwise covers the Mayor's every step (ec). Or is it? <p/> HERE'S an excerpt from last night's debate, to prove how recently ago some people took the now fatal spatial interventions lightly and politicised them, and how "everything" is politics (only how will they justify them tomorrow? ): <p/> "... Radovljica's landscape will be by far the most damaged by the semi-tubed AC of all the interventions. The unnatural embankments on both sides take away from the plain what is most valuable and distinctive, or add something alien to it ..." / Statement by a representative of the KR Institute for the Protection of Natural and Cultural Heritage, ... who also informed us that we have insufficiently illuminated pedestrian crossings ...?/. <p/> (J.U.: Madam, just where was she during the mayor's "semi-digging" into the AC problems? <p/> Another, this time verbal, proof: <p/> Semi-deepening is of course not "deepening" and more than obviously nothing good, useful can be born out of "semi-(itic) deepening". <p/> We have evidence, look out of the car window when you drive down the main road ...).
__label__objective Repayment of the third quarter <p/> A press conference was held today, 25 February 2014, at the premises of the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport (MESS) at 16 Masarykova cesta in Ljubljana, where State Secretary AljuÅ¡ PertinaÄ presented the method of securing funds for the payment of salary disproportions to public institutions that fall under the auspices of the Ministry of Education. <p/> According to the State Secretary, the Ministry of Education and Science received many negative reactions to the letter prepared by the Ministry of Finance concerning the provision of funds for the payment of the first instalment, namely that each direct and indirect budget user must provide the necessary funds for the payment of the salary differential due to the elimination of the third quarter of the basic salary disproportionality within its financial plans, since the additional funds needed for the payment of this obligation must not have an impact on the increase in the budget deficit. The MoFRE took the disagreements and professional concerns to the competent authorities in the Ministry of Finance and asked for help in resolving the issue, but "all they heard was that fiscal consolidation was continuing and that there was no money". <p/> The State Secretary said that, in view of the fact that the funds for the payment of the obligations under the Supreme Court judgment were not provided for in the 2014 Budget of the Republic of Slovenia, and in view of the aforementioned position of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia and the Ministry of Finance, the MoEFA, after careful consideration and in full awareness of the gravity of the situation, had decided to transfer the missing funds to the public institutions that would need the Ministry's assistance in securing the funds for the payment of payment of the first instalment of the salary disproportionality compensation. The Ministry's position is that the payment of the liabilities following the judgment should not adversely affect the performance of the core activities of public education and research. <p/> In January this year, the Ministry sent a letter to the indirect budget users under its responsibility stating that each indirect budget user in the field of activity of our Ministry should, as a rule, provide itself with the necessary funds for the payment of the first instalment of the salary difference, within the limits of the institution's available resources from previous years and the resources available for the implementation of the activities in 2014. Exceptionally, if a public institution demonstrates that it is unable to provide the funds to make the first instalment of the salary differential due to the abolition of the third quarter of the basic salary disparities, the Ministry should provide the additional funds. <p/> The Ministry assessed the institutions' applications for funds to pay the third quarter of the salary disproportionality according to uniform criteria, taking into account the estimated surplus of revenue over expenditure or expenditure over revenue as at 31.12.2013, taking into account the expenditure on the third quarter of the salary disproportionality for the period from 1.10.2010 to 31.7.2011. The Ministry co-finances applications from institutions up to an amount that covers the estimated deficit of expenditure over revenue as at 31.12.2013. In addition, according to AljuÅ¡ PertinaÄ, the Ministry also took into account the liquidity criterion and examined the balance of cash, bank credits and short-term financial investments as at 31.12.2013 in relation to the amount of the first instalment liability. <p/> For a full explanation of the criteria according to which the MoEFCC assessed the institutions' applications, please watch the video of the press conference below. <p/> Your comment:
__label__subjective Elvis KudiÄ, athlete (09 / 2013) <p/> When I first came to the Althea Centre, I was immediately taken care of. It all started with tap dancing, and then Nena and I talked about what I was training. I said athletics and that I was very scared of competitions, but Nena suggested mental training. After the first session I felt different, I have been doing it for a year now and the progress is very good (from 1 to 10 it's a 10! ). I am relaxed, confident, I have a goal in mind. Of course, there are still a lot of things to improve. I feel great in Althea. <p/> Kristina Novak, tennis player, 13 years old (09 / 2013) <p/> Filip ZupanÄiÄ, tennis player (08 / 2012) <p/> I've had a lot of mental training, but none has been as reliable as the IMTÂ® mental training at AltheaÂ®. During the training you relax (sometimes you almost fall asleep, although you are still fully concentrated) and when you wake up again you are full of energy. Nena and I have been working together for a little less than a year now and the results are obvious. I feel great even in the face of injuries, and I perform very confidently in tournaments. The exercises we do are reliable, they help me a lot. From my side that would be everything, I really recommend you if you have / will have any possible problem to come to AltheaÂ® and feel this great atmosphere. Filip <p/> BlaÅ¾ KavÄiÄ, top tennis player (07 / 2012) <p/> I first came into contact with the AltheaÂ® Health and Harmony Centre a little over two years ago when I had to put my best friend (tennis racket) in a corner because of a tear in the back of my leg. I was in great mental distress as no therapy was helping and I didn't know what to do. For a top athlete, there is nothing worse than having to lie down and rest... Since then, I have always turned to them when I am in trouble. <p/> As soon as I entered Althea I knew I had come to the right place. On the first day of therapy I was welcomed by a physiotherapist and her friend TecarÂ®. After just a few therapies I could feel a big difference. My leg was more relaxed and the pain slowly subsided, and soon I was able to return to the tennis courts again. But there was still one big problem... I couldn't put the same strain on my leg as before the injury and I felt I couldn't help it. I had a brake in my head ... <p/> That's when Nena came to my rescue. With IMTÂ® training, we broke through the block in a few days and my movement on the court became much better and I felt I was the one on the court again, because it was very difficult to send the ball past me. Nena also taught me to listen to myself and my body. Now I can often help myself. <p/> I would like to thank everyone at AltheaÂ® from the bottom of my heart, because they have saved me many difficult days that I would have had to spend without tennis. TecarÂ®, BionicÂ®, IMTÂ® and kinesiotaping is surely the best combination of therapies for injury recovery and I highly recommend AltheaÂ® to anyone who needs help. <p/> BlaÅ¾ KavÄiÄ <p/> Miran Stanovnik (28.5.2012, after his injury in Dubai, completion of therapy) <p/> After Miran's injury in Dubai, in addition to physiotherapy and kinesiotaping, we also did IMTÂ® intuitive mental training and energy therapies as a support to the basic therapy, in order to speed up rehabilitation and to clean up the effects of the injury on all other levels, not only on the physical body. The following is a description of his experience, which was very powerful, because he gave himself completely to the therapy and his intention was to completely rehabilitate all the consequences (physical, mental, energetic) of this injury, as well as all the previous ones that had happened to him, in the shortest possible time, which is why the reaction was more intense and the result was extremely fast, which was his intention, which he had set for himself. <p/> Dear friends, My meetings with my pleasant and professional friends from the AltheaÂ® Centre in Lesce are coming to their final stage. The rehabilitation has more than succeeded. But I have tried something new again (at least for me). Nena kindly asked me if we could also try one energy therapy (reiki) together with IMTÂ® mental training. Of course, why not. Of course I didn't expect any revolution, but I participated fully, like everything I do. She also warned me that I might get a little cold after the treatment because the energy would be cleansing... Well yes, it's no joke I can tell you that. I got so cold on the way home after the treatment that I set the internal temperature in my car to 28 degrees Celsius and it wasn't enough. At home I covered my head with two blankets (not duvets) and that was barely enough. But within an hour my body reacted with a fever (38 degrees). After a few hours I just lift my head and ask Nena for a commentary on the events. Such a strong reaction to everything we did, cleansing on all levels, because I was prepared for it and went into the process "full on", says my therapist. Yes, I spent a few more days in bed, but the very next day there was a significant improvement in the condition of the injury, and the very next day I forgot about the crutches for walking around the flat, which means that it helped, and since that day I have only used them for walking up the stairs... A crazy good experience, I tell you. Now I've read it again and I see that my writing looks terribly "cracked", but I'm not going to correct it, because everything I said is true. <p/> Miran <p/> Jure RobiÄ, top extreme cyclist (09 / 2010) <p/> Dear Nena, I have been promising you for too long that I would write about how I experience our "sessions". Well, now I have made time for you, just as you have always made time for me whenever I need you, day or night. When I told you in the first session that I trusted you and believed in you and that you could do whatever you wanted, just to get better and get back to racing as soon as possible, I had no idea that change could be so fast and so effective. When you got me up and racing in four days after a serious injury, with the help of BionicÂ®, TecarÂ® and especially your IMTÂ® mental technique, I started to understand why things were happening to me in the lake in the first place. A new world is really opening up for me, as you predicted. I know it's all in my head, it's just that now, with your help, I know how to put what's bothering me out of my mind. I can't wait for us to continue. See you)) <p/> Miran Stanovnik, top motorcyclist (07 / 2010) <p/> My first meeting with Nena and AltheaÂ® was the result of a conversation and a personal recommendation from Jureto (RobiÄ), who couldn't praise the "treatments" enough. Despite the relatively long distance from my home, I regularly visited AltheaÂ® in Lesce when I had injuries, which are an integral part of almost every athlete's life. I have received individual massage treatment, BionicÂ® therapy, TecarÂ® therapy, as well as IMTÂ® intuitive mental training, a method I am really enthusiastic about. The result was shockingly good for me. I don't bother with the details of how each segment works, because for me it's important that it works. And that is for sure. <p/> I did not believe in it at first, but then I was convinced by the real effects, and I was completely taken in. At the beginning, I thought, what is this going to do for me, how can this possibly work, this is just something, blah blah blah, ... but, as I said, I was fascinated by the effect. Every human being has certain blockages, unprocessed patterns, every human being has a problem somewhere - maybe they are aware of it, maybe they are not. Nena, I was taken by her very calmness, I felt that myself. She is a woman I trusted immediately. After giving birth, I had a big problem with iron. There was no way, even with medical help, that it would improve. Quite by chance, when I met Nena, I complained about the matter and she suggested that we look at where I might have a blockage, the psychological reasons that were causing it. Well, we did find the cause: I had a desperate guilty conscience because I wasn't with my daughter non-stop and all that was eating my iron, and when we looked at all these patterns of guilt, cleared them up, came to terms with it, when I looked the matter in the eye, it got abnormally better and better. During the Olympic Games in Vancouver, Nena and I spent a lot of time in contact via Skype. This IMTÂ® mental training can also be done remotely, and she helped me to step over difficult mental barriers. I was able to. Sometimes you may think that the problem is somewhere on the surface, but when you look deep inside you realise that it's the patterns you have in you from childhood that are now "jumping out". I found myself in this IMTÂ® training, in this therapy. It helps me a lot. It's not just a therapy for sport, it's a therapy that enriches me for life. I realise that I still have a lot of work to do on myself and this is a method where you can see the effect after just one therapy, you can see the progress, the change immediately. I recommend it to everyone who wants to be happy with themselves. For me, this therapy has opened my eyes, and I look at certain things with different glasses. I calm down when I have therapy with Nena, she calms me down, after all it is my time, which I spend on myself and enrich myself. <p/> Vasja Rupnik, biathlon team Slovenia (06 / 2010) <p/> I myself have never believed in intangible, unexplainable things, but after I started working with the AltheoÂ® Centre, with Nena, I started to realise that it is only the ego that is the problem to a better and more confident performance in competitions, and in life! With the help of therapies, which are not even therapies, but a conversation, or with Nena's help, digging into your subconscious, you discover that fears and blockages are part of you, you just have to dare to discover them, to do that you need the desire for a better and easier life, of course, without Nena's help and guidance it's not possible, so thank you for the feedback and I recommend it for the future! <p/> Maja Kokol, children's presenter, animator and singer (05 / 2010) <p/> I have been dedicated to children in my work in various ways for 23 years. Working and socialising with them has confirmed to me over and over again how fairy-tale and magical this world is. That is why I believe in miracles, fairy tales and angels - Nena is certainly one of them. The severe trials, the extreme sadness and the fear of "tomorrow" are the circumstances that have brought her my way. I am a great optimist but I can say that without her help I would not have made it through that period - especially not in that way. Nena is not only a friend but also a great therapist who gives me energy, warmth, words... - whatever she feels I need at that moment. Because she is so visibly successful in all this, her ideas, advice or just telling me about something good always opens my heart and makes me curious - and so it was with the IMTÂ® technique. She changed my life, completely - turned it upside down like a whirlpool, leaving behind the devastation of old patterns, thoughts, connections and sowing new seeds with a firm and determined will. That is why, my dear Nena, you are my angel - in all forms, in all areas. With your help, I have become who I am and for that I will always be grateful! <p/> Nika, tennis player (02 / 2011) <p/> IMTÂ® therapy helps me with all the things I do, not just tennis. I have noticed much less fussing (if any) about others or about external things that I can't control. I am much more in touch with myself and my needs. I am somehow living more in a kind of "peace". At the beginning I had doubts in myself in terms of opening up. I am a person who finds it very difficult to trust someone completely and therefore to believe them. I have to say that I trusted you from the very beginning of our IMTÂ® therapy, which is not typical for me. The therapies also help me in general in my life and are not only related to sports. In fact, for many years I lived in a bubble that I didn't want to get out of. Everybody could say or do anything to me, but I always acted completely calm on the outside. With your help, I am now actually speaking my mind, without fearing the outcome. I don't even think about what if it had been, or why it happened, but I live in the moment and do what needs to be done. My own execution, accuracy and power of my strokes has also improved with the IMTÂ® therapies we do. <p/>Spella (12 / 2011) <p/>The barrel of repressed problems and fears has finally been filled. There was no more room and the eruption had to happen. For me as a psychological problem. I landed on antidepressants. But since I am still too young to walk with crutches (that's what doctors call treating mental problems with pills) I decided to take matters into my own hands. I knew that Nena had a health centre, but I had no idea how it could help me. But since the devil is still a fly in the ointment, I figured it couldn't get any worse and called her. We made an appointment for therapy. And lo and behold, after the very first IMTÂ® session, I felt relief. A second one followed, and a third, ... Today I feel really great and I am eternally grateful to Neni. And yet more proof that the therapies really do help. One of my many fears was walking in the woods. I didn't go there alone if I could, even though I enjoy the woods. Every noise made me shiver, I was afraid of meeting a person, an animal... This fear of mine was rooted deep in my subconscious and stemmed from events in my past. After one of the therapies I went to the forest to test the effect. Alone. Amazing. The fear of forest visitors and the silence with the occasional rustling of leaves, wind, ... was gone. Walking means relaxation, recharging my batteries, talking to myself. <p/> Everything in life happens for a reason. Nena, you were one of the better and more beautiful ones. Thank you. I love coming back to therapy because it really helps me to understand what is going on around me. Therapies make my perception of the world more positive.
__label__subjective Friday 29 December 2006 <p/> In December 2006, on the margins of the European Social Platform meeting at the Grand Hotel Union in Ljubljana, representatives of the Family Initiative met with Mr William Lay, Executive Director of COFACE - ConfÃ©dÃ©ration des Organisations Familiales de l'Union EuropÃ©enne, or in Slovene the Confederation of Family Organisations of the European Union. We presented to Mr Lay the state of family policy in Slovenia and the efforts of the Family Initiative to develop family-friendly legislation in Slovenia. We presented the current proposals and initiatives for legislative change in Slovenia that we have prepared in the Family Initiative. We presented proposals to increase the competitiveness of parents in the labour market, proposals to improve the conditions for families with several children in the area of childcare, proposals to amend pension legislation and proposals for a fairer distribution of the costs of childcare between parents and individuals without children. The overall conclusion of the participants was that the Family Initiative is working on proposals that are also relevant for other members of the European Alliance. On the other hand, we can better draw on experience from abroad to identify family policy measures that have already shown results there. Family policy is implemented in each Member State separately and in a disconnected manner, and the European Union does not have a common family policy. For this reason, NGOs working to improve family policy in individual countries have joined together to form a common organisation, COFACE. So far, there has been no Slovenian representative in this organisation. That is why Mr Lay invited the Family Initiative to take an active part in this association. Those present agreed that membership in this organisation would be beneficial for both the Family Initiative and family policy in Slovenia. We believe that the benefits of membership would also justify the additional costs associated with membership. We parted with the hope of meeting next time as full members of COFACE, and thus to work together on family policy in the European Union. <p/> Thursday 12 October 2006 <p/> The coalition groups listened to the warnings of the Family Initiative that the proposed Income Tax Law, in the article providing for tax relief for dependent children, should be amended so as not to worsen the relative position of parents compared to taxpayers without children. Based on our warnings, the NSi, SDS and SLS groups of MEPs have drafted amendments to correct the draft law. In the course of the coordination with the Ministry of Finance, it was finally decided to amend the Bill by increasing the progressivity step of the tax relief from the third child onwards from EUR 748 to EUR 1500. While this solution does not meet the full requirements of the Family Initiative, it does address the main anomaly and shortcoming of the proposed law. For a number of families, the proposal will also not only maintain, but even slightly improve their relative position compared to taxpayers with the same income without children. <p/> Compared to the original proposal of the Family Initiative, the State will now make some savings and we expect that this will make it easier to implement other, perhaps even more important, family policy measures, such as incentives for parents to take up employment after the return of parental leave and part-time work. <p/> At this point, I would like to commend the cooperation of the expert colleagues of the NSi and SDS Groups of Members of the European Parliament and of some of their MEPs, who, during the negotiations with the Ministry of Finance, also checked the proposals and solutions they discussed with us, thus enabling us to participate constructively in this process with our own calculations and assessments. <p/> Tuesday, 30 May 2006 <p/> On World Family Day in May, we held a well-attended round table discussion at the General Assembly entitled The fertility problem between parents and the state, which was attended by the Minister of Finance, Dr Andrej Bajuk, the State Secretary at the Ministry of Education and Science, Dr Magdalena Å verc, the Director of the Directorate for the Family at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Social Development, Ms Majda Erzar, and the Acting Head of the Housing Sector at the Ministry of the Interior, Ms Anita HoÄevar Frantar. The round table and its content were reported in most media. <p/> Thursday, 01 December 2005 <p/> The Family Initiative wrote to Prime Minister Janez JanÅ¡a on 4 November 2005 asking for a discussion on measures to increase the birth rate and improve the situation of families, and the context of the proposed reforms from the perspective of parents and families. <p/> On 25.11.2005 we received a rather vague reply from the Prime Minister's Office.
__label__subjective Home - Ski Jumping - News - Everything is ready for the 2020/21 season grand final in Planica <p/> Everything is ready for the 2020/21 season grand final in Planica <p/> 17.03.2021 <p/> Ahead of the Ski Jumping World Cup season finale, which will take place at the GoriÅ¡ka Brothers Aerodrome next week, the representatives of OK Planica have summarised their thoughts and views. <p/> Enzo Smrekar, President of SZS and President of OK Planica <p/> After three successful World Championships in Slovenia and after all three World Cup competitions, we are now looking forward to the end of the season with the final in Planica. We are expecting all the teams, a great finish and a top organisation. Unfortunately, there will be no spectators again, hopefully for the last time. What is important is that we are working hard to partially cover the loss from the cancelled race last March. The expectation is that this event will also work with a positive zero and will partly contribute to covering the seasonal shortfall. <p/> I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all our loyal sponsors. Without them, it would not have been possible. Thanks also to all the workers and staff who work with great enthusiasm to ensure that our matches are held to a high standard. And of course, thanks to OK Planica, which oversees all of this and takes care of the event itself. I am sure that the media and all the teams will feel welcome, even though the precautions are strict. They are dictated by the profession on the one hand and by the precaution that has marked us this year as one of the top World Cup race organisers where there have never been any infections or cancellations. <p/> As we were wrapping up the World Championships in December, our minds were already somewhat on the World Cup in March. At that time, we imagined that we would now be able to welcome the first live spectators in the valley below Ponce. Unfortunately, even after all these months, and especially after the intense discussions in recent weeks, we can only conclude with sadness that we will not be welcoming spectators this year either, and that the measures that were in place in December are still in force. This means that everyone taking part in this competition will be staying in a so-called snow hut. Two areas will be set up, the so-called green area and the grey area. Protected areas in which the competition will run as smoothly as possible. The media regime will be similar to that in December. It applies both to work in the media centre and in the mixed zone. <p/> We have also worked quite a lot on the idea, which was already alive in December, of spectators watching the Alpine Skiing Competition from vehicles. Unfortunately, we cannot confirm this here today either. Not only the large amounts of snow we have received this winter, but also the epidemiological situation in Slovenia and in wider Europe is not yet good enough to make this possible. With our loyal sponsor, Zavarovalnica Triglav, we have once again prepared the so-called virtual fan stand, which will be located at the exit of the GoriÅ¡ka Brothers Airport. There, virtual spectators will be able to tune in to the competition itself via a remote meeting tool. I would already like to invite all interested parties to register on the triglav.si/planica website. There they will then wait for the call to watch the match. <p/> Planica will be different from everything we have already tried in December. These experiences have been very rewarding. The regime will be similar, but we learned a few things then. Despite the stricter requirement in Slovenian law that all participants in sporting events must be tested every 48 hours, we will stick to it. The extra day of competition makes the risk of infection even greater. We do not want this to happen at the start of the season. We want to maintain our reputation as a good, excellent organiser and that is why this decision has been taken. The rules for World Cup ski jumping competitions in the FIS family are slightly different and in some points even stricter than we are used to elsewhere. <p/> At the moment we have 16 teams registered. Approximately 186 people are on the accreditation list. Access to the valley will be restricted from this weekend. Initially there will be a partial restriction, but from Monday onwards the valley will be virtually closed to all outside visitors. Access will be restricted to accredited persons only. <p/> Preventive measures against covid-19 remain in place. Call for distance, wearing FFP2 masks at all times and disinfection! This is absolutely in place. Please adhere to it, everyone. <p/> As a point of interest, if we hosted the games under floodlights in December, the games during the week will be held in the afternoon, but still in daylight conditions. And with TV Slovenia's TV coverage, we will once again provide additional attractive spots, so this time the coverage from Planica will also be something special. I can say that I have a proof copy of the book that will be published on the occasion of this year's Plania competition. I am sure it will be very well received by everyone. The GoriÅ¡ka brothers are fatally linked to Planica and Planica to them. This is one more moment of this year's Planica. <p/> The budget this time is a few euros short of EUR 1.5 million. If we compare this with the classic finals in previous years, it is as much as half as much. We have had to work very hard to turn every euro around and spend it as economically as possible so that the final calculation shows a positive zero. Unfortunately, the absence of spectators has resulted in a loss of approximately 35% of revenue. If we add to this the loss made last March, the situation is not enviable, but it is not unmanageable. We and our team at OK Planica will do our utmost to successfully eliminate this loss. In addition to our loyal sponsors, who have stood by us all these years, I would like to thank the Ministry of Defence, the Slovenian Armed Forces and, of course, the Slovenian Police, who, with their members, always make sure that Planica is as it is, as we are used to it, and I believe that it will be special this time too, although it will be different, because the spectators will not be able to come to the valley below Ponce. <p/> AljoÅ¡a Dolhar, Competition Manager <p/> I feel a certain amount of responsibility. This year, from the very beginning, the preparations have been a bit different than usual. We had a specific situation and we had three types of snow on the airfield. We had about 4000 cubic metres of snow left over from the March event, which we stored and then used in December. A lot of natural snow fell on top of that. We estimate the quantity to be around 12 000 cubic metres. In addition, we produced about 5,000 cubic metres of artificial snow. During the winter races, in cooperation with NC Planica, we kept the ski jump and the run-off area tamped, the snow compacted, mixed and, above all, prevented from sliding. On the downhill run, we also kept the ski from December. Only this one had to be cleaned and re-cut. The situation at the moment is such that today we have started removing the spare snow that we had stored in the run-out. We are spreading the snow on the runway with a tamping machine. We have the skis practically ready, so we are just waiting to open them and start using them. We will be ready with the machine work on Friday afternoon. We are planning a big operation on Saturday and Sunday with our team to get everything ready for the test on Tuesday. <p/> Today and tomorrow in Planica there are optional training sessions for the pre-competitors. After tomorrow we will form a team of 20-25 jumpers who will jump next week. On Tuesday at 15:30 we expect the first series of the aerodrome test. The second series is planned for 17:00, so that we can test the visibility and conditions at the same time. As far as the weather forecast is concerned, I have to say that it is quite favourable at the moment. From Tuesday onwards we expect stable weather, with moderate temperatures. At night it will be -5 to -8, which will make our work easier. Daytime temperatures will range from 2 to 8 degrees. The weather will be partly clear to mainly cloudy, which is better than very clear. I hope this forecast is accurate. Wind conditions should also be very stable. The weather is also very good for us at the moment. Who will jump first will be known after tomorrow's practice. <p/> This year in Planica the whole jury of the competition will change, not only the competition director. There is also a change of TD and ATD. We will see what this means on Sunday after the competition. The Technical Delegate will be Ivo Greger from the Czech Republic, who I understand has no experience with flying, but is an experienced TD. His assistant is my assistant on the flights, Thomas Hasselberger from Germany. We have worked well together at all the airshows and I hope that this will make a difference and that we will work harmoniously as a jury.
__label__subjective Martin Milec is ready for the games after the physiotherapist's care (with Mirzet SpreÄo by his side) <p/> Photo: Miha Vidrih <p/> Successful first presentation of the renewed Maribor team. Not because of the victory or the four goals in the Ptuj net, but mainly because of the hard work and serious approach to the game already in the opening test. <p/> It is noticeable what competition means. The boys are aware that several players are candidates for the starting eleven at certain positions, and they are fulfilling all their obligations with 100 per cent commitment. In training, the coaching staff tried out some innovations and implemented one of them during the match. Martin Milec played half-time as a right-back and after the match against Drau he said: "I joked that I had a headache this time because I had to think more in my new position (laughs). It was good for the first attempt to play in a changed role against a slightly weaker opponent. I was still good on the offensive end, but I have to make sure I get in sync with the defensive line. Maybe I can play another game in this position in the future. " <p/> Together with his teammates, the young Slovenian international was eager to start the competitive part of his preparations. "After a series of training sessions, we were all already looking forward to the first match. I think we did a good job. Of course, we are not yet fully aligned, but there is plenty of time to work on our shortcomings before the start of the championship. " One of the positive lessons from the premiere is the effectiveness of the breaks. It was Martin Milec who scored accurately from a free kick alongside Dejan Mezga. "I have been training them since before. I stayed after training and Goran Cvijanovic and I competed in free kicks. I did well. Before the shot in the match, I believed I would execute it well. And indeed the ball ended up in the net. " <p/> After Ptuj, it's Celjani's turn. On Saturday at 15:00, the second preparatory test will take place on the artificial turf pitch in Ljudski vrt. "It's a tougher game than the one against Drava, but we'll be playing against top league teams. Then we go to Madeira, where we will try to improve our tactics. After returning home, we will start the last part of our preparations in the remaining days until the start of the championship. We know what our goal is. And we know how to achieve it. That's why we are working hard during the preparations. We had good weather in the first week, and now we sometimes get cold fingers in the colder temperatures, but we warm up enough in the running part. The ball is also faster in these conditions on artificial grass, but we are getting there. "

__label__objective Telekom's General Meeting today on a special audit of certain transactions <p/> At today's General Meeting in Ljubljana, Telekom Slovenije shareholders will decide, among other things, on a proposal by Kada and Soda for a special auditor to examine the management of Telekom Slovenije's individual transactions over the last five years. This is the time when the company was managed by both the former CEO Bojan Dremelj and the current CEO Ivica KranjÄeviÄ. <p/> Kapitalska druÅ¾ba (Kad) and Slovenska odÅ¡kodninska druÅ¾ba (Sod), which together own a fifth of Telekom, are demanding an investigation into Telekom's acquisitions in Slovenia and abroad, real estate purchases and sales, and major investments, among other things. The auditors are to assess, among other things, whether the transactions were economically justified, transparent and secured, and how they affect the company in terms of risk exposure. <p/> Last July, the company's Supervisory Board instructed KranjÄeviÄ's team to initiate appropriate legal proceedings against the former Telekom management regarding their liability. The audit report on the acquisitions in Macedonia and Najdi.si identified a number of shortcomings. <p/> The former management of Telekom Slovenije, headed by Dremlje, supports the proposal for a special audit, stressing that it acted diligently, but the current management says that it understands this request as an interest in a more in-depth examination of certain transactions, or an examination of the management of these transactions over the last five years, and certainly not as a vote of no confidence in the current management, which took office barely a year ago. <p/> In addition, the General Meeting will decide on the authorisation to purchase own shares, following a request in January from shareholders representing 5.82% of the company's share capital. The shareholders are NFD, Kapitalska druÅ¾ba, Perspektiva FT, NLB, Primorski fondi and Zavarovalnica Triglav. (STA)

__label__subjective Friday 01 August 2008 <p/> This autumn there will be elections to the National Assembly. Therefore, in the first half of June, we sent a questionnaire to the parliamentary parties asking about their attitude towards family policy, the work they have done so far and their plans or promises for the new mandate in this area, as well as their opinion on some concrete proposals of the Family Initiative. We asked the parties to return the questionnaires to us by the end of June. <p/> Only the NSi group sent us a fully completed questionnaire within the deadline. They expressed their support for most of our proposals and listed several solutions they had proposed and implemented during the current mandate. In addition to the more high-profile ones, which you are probably all familiar with, let me mention two less well-known ones, such as the 50 per cent reduction in the contribution for the use of public roads for families with four or more children and the abolition of the administrative fee for marriage. The fact that these are not just words is borne out by the experience of this term, when the NSi Group of Deputies has repeatedly asked us for our opinion or for consultation, and our proposals have been taken on board, at least to some extent. Of course, we would have been even happier if there had been more of this. <p/> The second and so far last questionnaire was sent to us by the LDS. The questionnaire is only partially filled in and considerably less specific. For the most part, they did not really say anything about the specific proposals of the Family Initiative, with the predominant answer being "it is interesting, needs to be changed, and then maybe worth supporting", with the feasibility mostly based on the constraints of public finances, and with quite a few of the proposals they also made it clear that they did not support them. Interestingly, despite the fact that they have had the scissors and the canvas for 12 years and that the situation has not deteriorated in recent years (in some areas it has improved), they are very critical of the current state of family policy. <p/> We were also promised a questionnaire by the SLS, but have not received it to date. They have repeatedly shown their support for pro-family solutions in the past and have proposed some of their own. We hope that they will also send us something more concrete as soon as possible. <p/> The SD referred us to their alternative government programme, which is quite interesting reading in some points and also promises some of the solutions that the Family Initiative has been pointing out for quite a number of years. In some areas they advocate completely opposite proposals, and in others the text is quite intangible. Caution in reading it is warranted by past experience, because when the party had significant influence in government for a number of years, there was no real will and no real listening to the same proposals. You can find the programme on the SD website. <p/> Lipa has sent us its statutes and programme, and has promised an electoral programme. The party programme received contains very little that is tangible, and not much space is given to parents and the family. Perhaps the electoral programme will be something more concrete. <p/> Sunday 22 June 2008 <p/> This autumn there will be elections for Members of the European Parliament. A significant part of our electorate are parents, and so their attitudes, plans and work on family policy so far are also important to us when choosing parties and candidates for the parliament. <p/> The Family Initiative, the Association for a Family Friendly Society, is a non-partisan association of parents and friends of families that has been working for the best possible position of families in Slovenian society for 10 years. During this time, several governments have changed and we have held a critical mirror up to all of them, proposing the best possible solutions, opposing the bad ones, praising the good ones... This has certainly been the best demonstration of our professionalism and party independence, which is why our membership has been growing. <p/> Before the 2008 elections, we would like to ask all parliamentary parties about their attitudes to family policy, what they have done in the past (you know, actions count for more than promises) and what they intend to do in the next parliamentary term, if the electorate entrusts you with the leadership of the country. <p/> That's why we have contacted all political parties and asked them to fill in a questionnaire on their attitudes towards family policy. Once we have compiled the results, we will also present them to the public. For those parties that do not respond, we will assume that they are not interested or do not consider this area worthy of attention. <p/>Family Initiative hopes that the questionnaire has been / will be accepted by the parties as an opportunity to present their programme and plans in a concrete way.

__label__subjective Added to project. Now we can create an A4 invoice and it is printed on A4. Later, we can print it on pos via Invoice Viewer, but it is already copy 1. <p/> This would come into play when we give someone an offer and later they pay in cash and we give them a pos printout. I suggest that somehow we add the option to print via pos printer, whether it be "Create pos invoice" or some other option for pos printout and cash payment. Cash payment is already possible if we do not choose another payment type (TRR or card), just a pos printout would be welcome. <p/> As already stated "if we do not choose another payment type (TRR or card)", the invoice is entered as cash and is confirmed by FURS. For A4 printout, the invoice prints ok. However, if we print the invoice later via the "Invoice Viewer" on the pos printer, it does not print CASH at the very end, but FOR PAYMENT. <p/> When the option for pos printout is added already in the base, I guess this will be reconciled? <p/> Sorry, I don't know how to do it right. If the due date is set to a later date, it will print FOR PAYMENT in the pos statement, but CASH in the A4 statement, and if the due date is the same date as the invoice it will print CASH in both cases. <p/> However, it might be a good idea, if the upgrade is to be made so that the offer can also be used for cash payment and the pos printout, to automatically set the due date for cash payment to the invoice date, or to always print CASH, because we don't print the due date on the cash invoice itself, and it shouldn't be on the A4 printout of the cash invoice, because if we have a due date set for a later date in the offer, the invoice automatically takes it into account, and then the due date is later on the A4 printout, but the cash payment is today, for example. It all works a bit illogically. Paid in cash, but we offer a due date?
__label__subjective Admission of financial instruments to regulated trading <p/> The decision to list a financial instrument on a stock exchange is one of the most important decisions to be taken by a company or its owners. Listing your company's shares on a regulated securities market will increase your company's reputation and visibility. This is expected to be reflected not only in your upstream and downstream markets, but also in attracting new quality staff to your company and, last but not least, it will make it easier for your company to raise fresh debt or equity capital, while the market price movement of the share will also reflect your performance and that of your employees. Of course, the decision to list must be made in a considered manner, as, in addition to the benefits mentioned above, listing also brings additional requirements and costs for the company: ensuring transparency, keeping the entire investing public informed of important developments in the company's business or assets, etc. <p/> Is this your situation? <p/> You are an entrepreneur or co-owner of a family-owned company, you have no successor and you wish to withdraw from active management of the business and divest your ownership interest in the company or part of it. <p/> You are planning a high growth business which will be difficult to finance from your own resources and you need additional sources of finance, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain finance from banks or venture capital providers. <p/> You intend to increase your company's presence abroad. <p/> We can help you... <p/> Our team of experts can help you: <p/> services related to the initial or resale sale of securities, <p/> advice on the promotion prior to the issuance of securities, <p/> advice on the placement of securities, <p/> advice on the placement of securities, <p/> advice on the placement of securities. <p/> advice on the obligations related to becoming a public company, in particular advice on ensuring that all stakeholders are equally informed (disclosure of controlled information) and advice on the drafting of internal acts and policies (definition of the flow of inside information and protection of its confidentiality, establishing a list of persons with access to inside information, defining the conditions, permitted and obligatory practices in relation to trading in the issuer's shares, etc.), <p/> advising on the establishment of an investor relations function/department, etc. <p/> Financial and business advice to help you go beyond existing frameworks.

__label__objective Description. The type and quantity of pollutants in rainwater varies temporally and spatially depending on a number of factors that are non-linearly interrelated: climate, road surface, traffic, land use and other local specificities. Slovenia does not yet have a methodology for sampling rainwater, nor is there a comprehensive long-term monitoring study of rainwater quality. In the first part of the thesis, we have collected literature on the topic of rainwater harvesting, with a focus on Slovenian literature. The experimental part consists of the selection of rainwater treatment facilities suitable for sampling, the determination of the sampled parameters, and manual sampling of the influent and effluent during rainfall events between October 2009 and August 2010. In the first phase, we captured single instantaneous samples within the first wave of the rainfall event, and later we increased the frequency of sample collection. The results obtained were analysed and possible amendments to the current legislation on road rainfall water were proposed and conclusions were drawn to help developers of road rainfall water management methodologies, with a focus on road rainfall water sampling.
